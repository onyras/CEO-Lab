# CEO Lab Workshops

This folder contains interactive workshops designed to be completed by Niko or other team members using Claude.

## Purpose

Workshops are structured prompts that guide someone through a comprehensive exploration of a specific topic, resulting in detailed outputs, decisions, and copy.

## How to Use Workshops

1. **Open the workshop file** (usually `workshop.md`)
2. **Copy the entire content**
3. **Paste into Claude** (claude.ai or Claude Code)
4. **Work through each section** systematically
5. **Save the output** in the same folder as `output.md`

## Current Workshops

### Landing Page Workshop

**Two versions available:**

#### 1. Full Workshop (Comprehensive)
**Location:** `landing_page/workshop.md`
**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Format:** Deep exploration with full paragraphs and examples
**Output:** Complete landing page with all copy written, psychological strategy, and detailed rationale
**When to use:** When you need finished copy and want comprehensive thinking

#### 2. Sprint Workshop (Rapid)
**Location:** `landing_page/workshop_sprint.md`
**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Format:** Bullet points only, quick decisions
**Output:** Strategy framework and key copy decisions to expand from

## Creating New Workshops

Use the template in `templates/workshop_template.md` as a starting point.

**Naming convention:**
```
workshops/
└── [topic_name]/
    ├── workshop.md          ← The prompt to paste into Claude
    ├── output.md            ← Completed responses (after workshop)
    ├── assets/              ← Supporting images/files
    └── notes.md             ← Additional context/decisions
```

**When to create a workshop:**
- When you need comprehensive thinking on a complex topic
- When you want someone else to explore a subject deeply
- When the output will inform major product decisions
- When you need detailed copy, strategy, or planning

**What makes a good workshop:**
- Clear goal stated upfront
- Sufficient context provided
- Systematic section-by-section structure
- Specific questions that prompt detailed answers
- Examples of expected output format
- Estimated time to complete
