## SECTION 1: HERO

### Headline
Are you getting better as a leader?

### Subheadline
Most CEOs don't know. CEO Lab measures your leadership across 18 dimensions so you can lead with data, not anxiety.

### Primary CTA
Take the Free Leadership Snapshot

### Trust Line (under CTA)
5 minutes. See what matters most in your leadership.

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM

### Section Title
Athletes Have Post-Game Analysis. What Do CEOs Have?

### Body Copy

Professional athletes review game footage. They track performance metrics. They know exactly where they're improving and where they're stuck.

You're running a company. Leading a team. Making decisions that affect people's lives and livelihoods. But when was the last time you objectively measured your own leadership?

Most CEOs operate without a scoreboard. You read books. Listen to podcasts. Maybe work with a coach. But you have no systematic way to know if you're actually getting better.

Without measurement, anxiety fills the gap. Every win feels like luck. Every challenge feels like proof you're not cut out for this. And the question that wakes you up at 3am: "Am I really the right person to lead this?"

You can't improve what you don't measure. And in 2026, with AI disrupting every industry and the pace of change accelerating, guessing isn't good enough anymore.

### Pull Quote (Optional Design Element)
"You can't improve what you don't measure. And guessing isn't good enough anymore."

## SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION

### Section Title
Introducing CEO Lab: Your Leadership Scoreboard

### Body Copy

CEO Lab is a leadership measurement platform built on the Konstantin Method - 60+ frameworks synthesized from 15 years of work with Series A-C founders.

We give you what athletes have: a baseline, systematic tracking, and objective feedback on whether you're improving.

Not another content library. Not more frameworks to browse. A scoreboard that shows you - with data - where you stand and where to focus next.

### The Core Promise

**Baseline Assessment**
100 questions measuring 18 leadership dimensions. Where you are right now, honestly.

**Weekly Tracking**
Three questions via WhatsApp. Two minutes. Tracks real behavioral change over time.

**Your Dashboard**
Visual progress across all dimensions. See your growth. Know what's working.

**Prescribed Frameworks**
Based on your scores, we tell you exactly which frameworks to focus on. No guessing. No overwhelm.

**AI-Generated Insights**
Monthly, quarterly, and annual reports showing patterns, breakthroughs, and what to work on next.

## SECTION 4: THE 18 DIMENSIONS

Choose 3 dimensions to focus on per quarter. Answer 3 questions weekly. Track your progress over time.

### Step 3: Improve

## SECTION 6: SOCIAL PROOF

### Testimonial

> "Before CEO Lab, I was making decisions based on anxiety, not data. I'd wake up at 3am wondering if I was actually growing as a leader or just getting lucky. The assessment showed me my blind spots in black and white - my delegation score was 32%. That was the wake-up call. Now, 90 days later, I'm at 68% and my team is making decisions without me. The anxiety is gone. I know exactly where I stand and where to focus next. That clarity alone is worth 10x the price."
>
> **— Sarah Chen, Founder & CEO, Series A SaaS (40-person team)**
