# CEO Lab: Report Design Specification v4.0
# What the CEO Sees

**Created:** 2026-02-06
**Version:** 4.0 (aligned to Assessment System v4.0 and Archetypes v4.0)
**Status:** Pre-pilot
**Purpose:** Define the complete output experience: narrative structure, visualizations, language, and framework prescriptions that a CEO receives after completing the assessment.

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. **Mirror, not manual.** The report shows the CEO themselves, not a textbook on leadership. Every section uses second person ("you"), refers to their specific scores, and reads like a conversation with a direct advisor.

2. **No jargon. No scores without stories.** Numbers appear alongside behavioral descriptions. A CEO should never encounter a score without an immediate, concrete explanation of what it means in their daily reality.

3. **Actionable, not comprehensive.** The report surfaces 3-5 priority dimensions, not 15. Information overload kills action. We respect the CEO's time and bandwidth.

4. **Honest without being brutal.** Low scores are named directly but framed developmentally. We don't sugarcoat and we don't shame. The tone is: "Here's what's happening, here's what it's costing you, and here's what you can do."

5. **Everything connects to the method.** Every dimension links to specific Konstantin Method frameworks. The report is the bridge between diagnosis and development.

## FULL ASSESSMENT REPORT: SECTION-BY-SECTION

---

### SECTION 1: THE HEADLINE

**Purpose:** Give the CEO one thing to sit with before they see any detail.

**Content:**
- CEO's name
- Date of assessment
- CLMI (CEO Leadership Maturity Index) as a single number: X%
- One-sentence interpretation of their CLMI range
- One-sentence preview of their strongest territory and their most pressing development territory
- If Mirror Check completed: Blind Spot Index (BSI) as a secondary metric

**Example output (without Mirror Check):**

> **Nikolas, your CEO Leadership Maturity Index is 62%.**
>
> This places you in the "Strong" range. Most CEOs at your stage score between 45% and 65%. Your strongest territory is Leading Yourself (74%). Your biggest opportunity for growth is in Leading Teams (51%).

**Example output (with Mirror Check):**

> **Nikolas, your CEO Leadership Maturity Index is 62%. Your Blind Spot Index is 18.**
>
> This places you in the "Strong" range. Your strongest territory is Leading Yourself (74%). Your biggest opportunity for growth is in Leading Teams (51%). Your Blind Spot Index of 18 suggests moderate self-awareness, with some notable gaps between how you see yourself and how your rater sees you. Section 6 of this report explores where those gaps are sharpest.

**Design notes:**
- CLMI presented as a large, visually prominent number
- BSI presented as a smaller secondary number when available (do not overshadow CLMI)
- No breakdown yet. This section is deliberately sparse. Let it land.
- If IM flag is triggered, this section includes the validity advisory (see IM handling below)

---

### SECTION 2: THE THREE TERRITORIES

**Purpose:** Show the CEO the landscape before the detail.

**Content:**
- Three territory scores (Leading Yourself, Leading Teams, Leading Organizations) displayed as a simple horizontal bar or radar visualization
- One sentence per territory summarizing the pattern
- The "arc" metaphor for each territory (see below)

**Visualization: Territory Overview**

```
Leading Yourself      ████████████████████░░░░░░  74%  Strong
Leading Teams         █████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░  51%  Building
Leading Organizations ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░  61%  Strong
```

**Arc narratives** (one sentence each, selected from templates based on score range):

*Leading Yourself arc:*
- 0-40%: "The inner foundation needs attention. Without this, everything else is built on shifting ground."
- 41-60%: "You're building self-knowledge, but it hasn't yet become consistent practice under pressure."
- 61-80%: "You have a solid inner foundation. The opportunity is deepening it into the kind of presence your team can feel."
- 81-100%: "Your inner work is genuinely strong. This is rare among CEOs and it shows in how people experience you."

*Leading Teams arc:*
- 0-40%: "Your team likely feels the gap between your intentions and their daily experience."
- 41-60%: "You care about your team and it shows, but the systems and conversations that make teams great aren't yet in place."
- 61-80%: "Your team is well-led. The next level is the difference between a team that performs and a team that thrives without you."
- 81-100%: "You've built something rare: a team that functions as a genuine leadership collective."

*Leading Organizations arc:*
- 0-40%: "Your organization has outgrown its operating system. The structure that got you here won't take you there."
- 41-60%: "You're beginning to think like an organizational architect, but the blueprints are still incomplete."
- 61-80%: "Your organization has real infrastructure. The opportunity now is in the places where strategy, culture, and structure don't yet align."
- 81-100%: "You're building an organization that can outlast any individual, including you. That's the ultimate test of a CEO."

---

### SECTION 3: YOUR 15 DIMENSIONS

**Purpose:** Give the CEO a complete picture of all 15 dimensions, organized by territory.

**Content:**
- Each territory header
- Each dimension within the territory: score, verbal label, and one-sentence interpretation
- Dimensions color-coded by range: Red (0-40%), Amber (41-60%), Green (61-80%), Blue (81-100%)

**Visualization: Dimension Heatmap**

For each territory, a compact display:

```
LEADING YOURSELF
  LY.1  Self-Awareness      ██████████████████░░  72%  Strong
  LY.2  Emotional Mastery    █████████████████████  84%  Mastery
  LY.3  Grounded Presence    ██████████████░░░░░░  58%  Building
  LY.4  Purpose & Mastery    ████████████████████░  78%  Strong
  LY.5  Peak Performance     ████████████████████░  76%  Strong
```

**One-sentence interpretations** are drawn from templates keyed to (dimension + score range). These are pre-written for all 15 × 5 = 75 combinations. Examples:

- LY.3 at 58% (Building): "You have moments of real groundedness, but under sustained pressure, the stillness disappears and reactive patterns take over."
- LT.2 at 34% (Early development): "Hard conversations are being avoided or softened. The cost is that small issues compound into organizational scar tissue."
- LO.1 at 78% (Strong): "Your strategic thinking is a genuine strength. The question is whether your team has internalized it with the same clarity you hold."

**Design note:** This section is scannable. CEOs should be able to absorb the full picture in under 2 minutes. Detail comes in the next section.

---

### SECTION 4: YOUR PRIORITY DIMENSIONS (Mirror / Meaning / Move)

**Purpose:** Deep dive into the CEO's 3-5 most important development dimensions.

**Selection logic:**
1. All dimensions scoring ≤ 40% are automatically included (max 3)
2. If fewer than 3 critical dimensions, add the lowest-scoring dimensions until 3 are reached
3. Add up to 2 "high-leverage" dimensions: dimensions where the gap between that dimension and a related dimension creates a pattern (e.g., high LY.1 Self-Awareness + low LT.2 Hard Conversations = "you see the problem but don't act")
4. Maximum 5 priority dimensions displayed
5. If Mirror Check data is available, dimensions with gaps ≥ 1.0 are prioritized

**Format for each priority dimension: Mirror / Meaning / Move**

This is the core report structure. Each priority dimension gets a full page.

**Mirror** (What the data shows)
- The dimension score, verbal label, and how it compares to the pilot baseline
- The specific behavioral item scores that contributed (no item text, but behavioral summary)
- SJI response for this dimension: what they chose and what it suggests
- If Mirror Check available: the gap and what it means

**Meaning** (What this means for you right now)
- 2-3 paragraphs written in second person, connecting the score to the CEO's likely daily experience
- The "cost of ignoring" statement from the dimension definition
- One question the CEO should sit with

**Move** (What to do about it)
- Primary framework prescription (based on score range, from the prescription logic table)
- One concrete practice for this week (specific, behavioral, time-bound)
- One framework deep-dive recommendation for this month
- If coaching client: note about discussing in next session

**Example: LT.2 Hard Conversations at 34%**

> **MIRROR**
>
> Your Hard Conversations score is 34%, placing you in the "Early development" range. This is your lowest score in the Leading Teams territory.
>
> Your behavioral responses suggest a pattern of delaying difficult feedback, waiting for the "right moment" rather than creating one. When conversations do happen, you tend to soften the message enough that it doesn't land with the weight it needs to.
>
> In the situational judgment scenario (a Head of Sales consistently underperforming), you chose to focus on understanding what support they need. This is empathetic, and it's also the most common choice among CEOs who score low on this dimension. The pattern: care becomes a reason to delay directness.
>
> **MEANING**
>
> Hard Conversations at 34% means the unsaid things in your organization are accumulating. You likely know exactly which conversations you've been postponing. You may have mentally rehearsed them. The gap between knowing and acting is where organizational trust erodes.
>
> Every week you wait, two things happen. First, the person on the other end of the conversation senses something is off but has no information to work with; your silence creates anxiety, not safety. Second, your leadership team learns that avoidance is acceptable, and this becomes a cultural norm that spreads.
>
> The question to sit with: *What is the kindest version of honesty you could offer the person you've been avoiding this conversation with?*
>
> **MOVE**
>
> **This week:** Identify the conversation you've been avoiding the longest. Schedule it. Use this opening: "I care about you and about this team, which is why I want to share something I've been holding back."
>
> **This month:** Work through the NVC (Nonviolent Communication) playbook and the Radical Candor framework in the Konstantin Method library. Focus on the distinction between honesty that serves you (venting) and honesty that serves the other person (developmental candor).
>
> **Framework prescription:** NVC basics, Radical Candor, 4 Ways of Listening

---

### SECTION 5: YOUR LEADERSHIP PATTERN (Archetypes)

**Purpose:** Show how dimensions interact to create recognizable patterns.

**Content:**
- Section introduction (from Archetypes v4.0 report template)
- 1-3 matched archetypes, each with:
  - Name + one-sentence description
  - "What this looks like" (condensed from full archetype to 3-4 sentences)
  - "What this is costing you" (2-3 sentences)
  - "The shift" (2-3 sentences + concrete practice)
  - Framework references
- If SJI patterns confirm: confidence note
- If SJI patterns contradict: exploration note
- Archetype progression note if applicable

**Display logic:**
- If IM ≥ 4: Polished Performer shown first with validity note
- Otherwise: Archetypes ranked by signature strength
- Maximum 3 displayed
- If 0 archetypes match: "Your profile doesn't match a single dominant pattern. This usually means a balanced profile or a transitional phase. Your dimension-level results above tell the more specific story."

**Design note:** Archetypes are the section CEOs remember most. The writing here must be sharp, honest, and unmistakably personal. Generic language kills credibility.

---

### SECTION 6: YOUR BLIND SPOTS (Mirror Check Only)

**Purpose:** Show the CEO where others see them differently.

**Included only when:** Mirror Check data is available.

**Content:**

**Visualization: Self vs. Rater**

A paired bar chart or dot plot showing CEO self-score and rater score for all 15 dimensions, sorted by gap size (largest gap first).

```
Dimension               You    Rater   Gap
LT.2  Hard Conversations  62%    38%    +24%  ⚠ Significant blind spot
LT.5  Leader Identity     71%    55%    +16%  ⚠ Mild blind spot
LO.2  Culture Design      45%    41%     +4%  Aligned
LY.1  Self-Awareness      72%    76%     -4%  Aligned (rater sees more)
...
```

**Narrative per flagged blind spot** (gap ≥ 1.0 on the 1-5 scale, equivalent to ~25% on the 0-100 scale):

> **Hard Conversations: You scored yourself at 62%. Your rater scored you at 38%.**
>
> This is the largest gap in your profile. You believe you address hard conversations when needed, but the person closest to your leadership experiences something different. This doesn't mean your rater is right and you're wrong. It means there's a gap worth exploring. What conversations do they see you avoiding that you don't notice?

**Negative gaps** (rater scores higher than CEO):

> **Self-Awareness: You scored yourself at 72%. Your rater scored you at 76%.**
>
> Your rater sees your self-awareness slightly more positively than you do. This may indicate healthy humility, or it may suggest you underestimate this strength. Either way, this is not a concern.

**Closing:** "Blind spots are not character flaws. They're information gaps. The most useful thing you can do with this data is have a 30-minute conversation with your rater about the dimensions with the largest gaps. Not to debate the scores, but to understand what they see."

---

### SECTION 7: YOUR DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

**Purpose:** Convert the assessment into a 90-day action plan.

**Content:**
- Top 3 priority dimensions (from Section 4) restated as development goals
- For each: the primary framework, the weekly practice, and the observable outcome
- Quarterly reassessment reminder

**Format:**

> **Your 90-Day Focus**
>
> 1. **Hard Conversations (LT.2):** Work through NVC and Radical Candor. Practice: one difficult conversation per week using the Honest Mirror structure. Observable shift: your leadership team starts having difficult conversations with each other, not just with you.
>
> 2. **Team Operating System (LT.4):** Implement the 4 Meetings Framework. Practice: redesign your weekly leadership team meeting using the playbook. Observable shift: meetings generate decisions, not just updates.
>
> 3. **Grounded Presence (LY.3):** Start a daily 10-minute mindfulness practice. Practice: before every high-stakes meeting, take 2 minutes to arrive fully. Observable shift: you notice when you're reactive before you act on it.
>
> **Reassessment:** Your next full assessment is scheduled for [date + 90 days]. Weekly Signature Questions will track your progress on these dimensions between now and then.

---

### SECTION 8: CLOSING

**Purpose:** End with dignity and motivation.

**Content (always shown):**

> "This report is a mirror, not a verdict. It shows where you are right now, shaped by the demands you face, the habits you've built, and the phase your company is in. None of it is fixed. The CEOs who grow fastest aren't the ones who score highest. They're the ones who see clearly, accept what they see, and do the work.
>
> That's what the next 90 days are for."

---

## STAGE 1 PREVIEW REPORT

For CEOs who complete Stage 1 (32 items) but have not yet completed Stages 2-3.

**Purpose:** Give enough value to motivate completing the full assessment.

**Sections:**
1. **Territory Overview:** Three territory scores (calculated from 15 behavioral items + 11 SJIs)
2. **Top 3 Signals:** The three lowest-scoring dimensions with one-sentence interpretations
3. **Archetype Preview:** "Based on your initial responses, you may match [archetype name]. Complete the full assessment for your detailed pattern analysis."
4. **CTA:** "You're 25 minutes from your complete leadership profile. Continue to Stage 2."

**Design note:** This report deliberately withholds the Mirror/Meaning/Move deep dives and the full archetype analysis. The preview must be valuable enough to feel worthwhile but incomplete enough to create genuine motivation to finish.

---

## HOOK ASSESSMENT REPORT (Free Tier)

For the 12-item free assessment.

**Purpose:** Deliver one genuine insight that earns trust and motivates the full assessment.

**Sections:**

1. **Your Territory Snapshot**
Three territory scores displayed as a simple bar chart. One sentence per territory.

2. **Your Sharpest Insight**
The single dimension with the most extreme score (highest or lowest) gets a 3-sentence insight.

If the extreme score is LOW:
> "Your lowest signal is in [dimension]. This suggests [one-sentence behavioral interpretation]. CEOs who score similarly here often find that [one-sentence cost]. The full assessment will show you exactly what's driving this and what to do about it."

If the extreme score is HIGH:
> "Your strongest signal is in [dimension]. This is a genuine strength: [one-sentence behavioral interpretation]. The question the full assessment answers: is this strength being fully translated into how your team and organization experience you?"

3. **Your Next Step**
> "This snapshot covers 12 of the 96 questions in the full CEO Leadership Assessment. The full version reveals your complete pattern across 15 dimensions, your leadership archetype, and a personalized 90-day development roadmap. [CTA: Take the Full Assessment]"

**Design note:** The hook report must avoid two failure modes: (1) giving so much that the CEO doesn't need the full version, and (2) giving so little that it feels like a trick. The key is one real, personal insight plus visible evidence that there's much more to discover.

---

## QUARTERLY PULSE REPORT

Generated from accumulated Weekly Signature Question responses.

**Purpose:** Show trajectory, not just position.

**Sections:**

1. **Your Trend Lines**
For each tracked dimension (CEO selects 3-5 per quarter): a line chart showing weekly self-ratings over the quarter.

2. **Velocity Indicators**
- ↑ Improving: Average of last 4 weeks > average of first 4 weeks by ≥ 0.5 points
- → Stable: No significant change
- ↓ Declining: Average of last 4 weeks < average of first 4 weeks by ≥ 0.5 points

3. **Pattern Notes**
AI-generated (or coach-written) observations on the trend data:
- "Your Hard Conversations score improved steadily for 6 weeks, then dropped in weeks 7-8. What happened around that time?"
- "Your Grounded Presence has been remarkably consistent, suggesting a stable practice is in place."

4. **Reassessment Prompt**
If end of quarter: "Your full reassessment is due. This will update your complete profile and show how your development has shifted your leadership pattern."

---

## IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT HANDLING

When IM ≥ 4, the report adapts throughout:

**Section 1 (Headline):** Advisory added:

> "A note on your responses: Your answers show a pattern of consistently positive self-assessment across multiple areas. This is common among high-performing CEOs, where projecting strength becomes a habit. However, this assessment is most useful when it captures your actual behavior, not your aspirations. If you feel this describes you, consider retaking the assessment with the intent to be radically honest about what your day actually looks like."

**Section 4 (Priority Dimensions):** Framework prescription adjusted to include IM-related frameworks:
- Add LY.1: Five Drivers (especially "Be Perfect" and "Be Strong")
- Add LY.1: Above the Line (honest self-location)

**Section 5 (Archetypes):** Polished Performer assigned as primary archetype with note:

> "The pattern below may become clearer with a more candid self-assessment. The Polished Performer isn't a criticism. It's a recognition that the armor that served you well may now be limiting what you can see."

**Section 6 (Blind Spots):** If Mirror Check available and IM flagged, Mirror Check data is given elevated prominence:

> "Because your self-report shows signs of idealization, your rater's perspective is especially valuable in this assessment. Pay particular attention to the gaps below."

---

## LANGUAGE AND TONE GUIDE

### Always:
- Second person ("you"), present tense
- Concrete, behavioral language ("you delay conversations" not "you have communication challenges")
- Warm but direct: the tone of a trusted advisor, not a therapist and not a consultant
- Short sentences. Short paragraphs. White space.
- Specific numbers with immediate context ("62%, which means...")

### Never:
- Framework jargon in the narrative (frameworks appear in prescribed sections, not in behavioral descriptions)
- Comparisons to other CEOs by name or company
- Normative percentiles ("you're in the 73rd percentile") because the pilot sample is too small for norms
- Hedging language ("might," "perhaps," "it's possible that")
- Exclamation marks
- Em dashes

### Tone calibration by score range:
- **0-20% (Critical):** Direct, urgent, compassionate. "This is costing you. Here's what to do."
- **21-40% (Early development):** Honest, non-shaming, developmentally oriented. "The pattern is clear and the path forward is concrete."
- **41-60% (Building):** Encouraging without cheerleading. "You're on the right track. Consistency is the challenge now."
- **61-80% (Strong):** Affirming with forward edge. "This is working. The next level looks like..."
- **81-100% (Mastery):** Genuine respect. "This is rare and it shows in how people experience you."

## REPORT WRITING: TEMPLATE INVENTORY NEEDED

The following pre-written templates are required before the report can be generated:

| Template | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Territory arc narratives (4 ranges × 3 territories) | 12 | Included above |
| Dimension one-sentence interpretations (5 ranges × 15 dimensions) | 75 | To be written |
| Mirror/Meaning/Move deep dives (3 ranges × 15 dimensions) | 45 | To be written |
| Archetype condensed portraits (12 archetypes) | 12 | Available in Archetypes v4.0 |
| Blind spot narratives (per dimension, flagged gaps) | 15 | To be written |
| Development roadmap entries (per dimension) | 15 | To be written |
| Hook Assessment insight templates (15 dimensions × 2 directions) | 30 | To be written |
| Weekly Pulse pattern observations (template library) | ~20 | To be written |

**Total templates to write: ~212**

This is a significant content creation effort. Recommended approach:
1. Write templates for the 5 most common low-scoring dimensions first (based on pilot data)
2. Expand to all 15 after pilot validates which dimensions differentiate most
3. Use pilot debrief conversations to calibrate language and tone
