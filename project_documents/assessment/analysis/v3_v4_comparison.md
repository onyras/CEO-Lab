## Why V4 Exists

V1-V3 used 18 dimensions that had drifted from the Konstantin Method's 15-dimension architecture. Frameworks ended up mapped to dimensions they didn't belong to. V4 eliminates the gap between the assessment and the method.

Each V4 dimension now has:
- Behavioral definition
- High/low indicators
- Cost of ignoring
- Specific Konstantin Method frameworks
- Prescription by score tier (0-40%, 40-70%, 70-100%)

## Impact on Product

- Question bank completely rewritten
- Scoring logic updated (added SJI composite)
- Dashboard dimension labels need updating
- Framework prescription mapping recalibrated
- Weekly check-in questions updated (15 instead of 18)
