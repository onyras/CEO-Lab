# V3 Assessment Quality Review

**Date:** 2026-02-06

---

## Summary

The V3 assessment used 18 dimensions across 3 territories with 100 questions. While comprehensive, several issues were identified that led to the V4 rebuild:

### Issues Identified

1. **Dimension drift:** 18 assessment dimensions had diverged from the Konstantin Method's actual 15-dimension architecture. Frameworks were mapped to dimensions they didn't belong to.

2. **No validity checks:** No impression management items to detect socially desirable responding. CEOs could (consciously or unconsciously) present an idealized picture.

3. **No situational judgment:** All items were behavioral self-report. Adding SJI items provides a second data source measuring what the CEO would DO under pressure, not just what they report doing.

4. **No external validation:** No Mirror Check mechanism to compare self-perception with external observation (360-lite).

5. **Naming inconsistency:** Three different naming systems existed across code, assessment docs, and dashboard strategy (e.g., "Emotional Fluidity" vs "Emotional Intelligence" vs "Emotional Intelligence").

6. **Missing time anchoring:** Not all items were anchored to specific time periods, leading to idealized rather than behavioral responses.

### What V3 Did Well

- Comprehensive coverage of leadership domains
- Clear staging system (30→60→100 with 60% milestone)
- Strong framework mapping to Konstantin Method playbooks
- Good question quality for behavioral self-report
- Weekly signature questions were practical and actionable

### Recommendations Implemented in V4

- Consolidated to 15 dimensions matching the Konstantin Method
- Added 15 SJI items (one per dimension)
- Added 6 IM items for validity checking
- Added 15 Mirror Check items (add-on)
- All items time-anchored to "past 30 days" or "typical week"
- Added forward/reverse scoring notation
- Added multiple response scales (Frequency, Degree, Confidence, Custom)
- Restructured staging to front-load engaging SJI content
