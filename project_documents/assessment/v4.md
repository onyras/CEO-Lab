# CEO Lab: Leadership Assessment System v4.0
# Aligned to the Konstantin Method

**Created:** 2026-02-06
**Version:** 4.0 (complete rebuild from v3.0)
**Decision Reference:** DL-012 (realignment to Konstantin Method architecture)
**Status:** Pre-pilot

---

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Why v4 Exists

Versions 1-3 used 18 assessment dimensions that had drifted from the Konstantin Method's 15-dimension architecture. Frameworks ended up mapped to dimensions they didn't belong to. A CEO who scored low on "Multiplier Behavior" got Multiplier frameworks, but in the actual method, Multipliers sits inside "Seeing What's Really Going On" (Diagnosis), not its own dimension. The assessment and the method were speaking different languages. v4 eliminates this gap entirely.

### Structure

| Component | Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Behavioral self-report items | 75 (5 per dimension) | What the CEO actually does |
| Situational Judgment Items (SJI) | 15 (1 per dimension) | What the CEO would do under pressure |
| Impression Management (IM) | 6 | Data integrity check |
| **Total** | **96** | ~40 minutes across 3 stages |
| Mirror Check (add-on) | 15 (1 per dimension) | What one trusted rater observes |

### The 15 Dimensions

**Leading Yourself** (Arc: See → Feel → Ground → Direct → Sustain)

## DIMENSION DEFINITIONS & FRAMEWORK MAPPING

Each dimension below includes: behavioral definition, what high and low look like, the specific Konstantin Method frameworks it contains, and what ignoring it costs.

---

### LY.1 SELF-AWARENESS (See)

**Behavioral definition:** The ability to recognize your own patterns, triggers, reactive tendencies, and blind spots in real time, before they drive your behavior.

**High indicator:** Catches reactive patterns mid-stream. Actively seeks feedback and is rarely surprised by it. Can name their default stress behaviors and watches for them. Recognizes their own contribution to recurring conflicts.

**Low indicator:** Repeatedly ends up in the same type of conflict with different people. Surprised by 360 feedback. Rationalizes reactive behavior as "just how I am." Attributes problems primarily to others or circumstances.

**Cost of ignoring:** CEOs with low self-awareness make the same leadership mistakes on rotation. They build organizations that reflect their blind spots, and because they can't see those blind spots, they can't diagnose why the same problems keep recurring despite changing personnel.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The Five Drivers
- The Drama Triangle
- Above the Line
- Reactive Patterns Playbook
- Dunning-Kruger / Munger's Inversion

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Five Drivers (identify your dominant driver), Above the Line (learn the basic distinction)
- 40-70%: Drama Triangle (map your default role), Reactive Patterns (build a personal pattern library)
- 70-100%: Munger's Inversion (advanced: invert your assumptions systematically)

---

### LY.2 EMOTIONAL MASTERY (Feel)

**Behavioral definition:** The ability to navigate emotions with precision in real time, without being hijacked by them, suppressing them, or confusing empathy with compassion.

**High indicator:** Names specific emotions accurately (not just "stressed" or "fine"). Expresses difficult feelings without blame or sarcasm. Recovers quickly from emotional activation. Offers genuine compassion without absorbing others' suffering.

**Low indicator:** Suppresses emotions that leak out as irritability, withdrawal, or passive-aggression. Avoids giving honest feedback to protect others' feelings (idiot compassion). Gets emotionally hijacked and regrets what they said or did. Uses "I'm fine" as a default.

**Cost of ignoring:** Emotional suppression erodes trust (people sense the gap between words and energy), leads to poor decisions under pressure, and eventually manifests as burnout, cynicism, or explosive episodes that damage relationships permanently.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The Wheel of Emotions
- The 50 Rules of Emotional Mastery
- The 4 Stages to Compassionate Leadership (+ Compassion Shift / Empathy Trap)
- Emotional Fluidity (Releasing Contracts)
- The Idiot Compassion Trap

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Wheel of Emotions (build emotion vocabulary), Idiot Compassion (recognize the pattern)
- 40-70%: 4 Stages to Compassionate Leadership, Emotional Fluidity
- 70-100%: 50 Rules of Emotional Mastery (refinement), Compassion Shift (advanced)

---

### LY.3 GROUNDED PRESENCE (Ground)

**Behavioral definition:** The cultivation of inner stillness that enables clear perception, full-attention listening, and wise action under pressure, rather than reactive autopilot.

**High indicator:** Maintains a regular contemplative practice. Listens without planning a response. Creates space before important decisions. Remains mentally present during high-stakes conversations. Can distinguish between urgency and importance in real time.

**Low indicator:** Mind races during rest. Constantly multitasks during conversations. Decides immediately under pressure without pausing. Feels mentally scattered. Confuses busyness with productivity.

**Cost of ignoring:** Without grounded presence, a CEO is perpetually reactive: making decisions from the last email rather than from strategic intent. The quality of every interaction, every decision, every relationship degrades when the leader cannot be fully present.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The 3 Styles of Meditation
- The Wheel of Awareness
- The 5 Enemies of Focus
- The Wisdom Quadrant
- The Flywheel of Leadership
- The Bandwidth Framework

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: 5 Enemies of Focus (diagnose attention leaks), Bandwidth Framework (understand your current capacity)
- 40-70%: 3 Styles of Meditation (establish practice), Flywheel of Leadership (build sustainable rhythm)
- 70-100%: Wheel of Awareness (deepen practice), Wisdom Quadrant (integrate wisdom into action)

---

### LY.4 PURPOSE & MASTERY (Direct)

**Behavioral definition:** Clarity about what drives you, commitment to working from your zone of genius, and deliberate pursuit of mastery on the path only you can walk.

**High indicator:** Spends majority of time on work that uses their deepest talents. Can articulate what they're building and why it matters to them personally. Actively practices and refines their craft. Makes life and work decisions from a coherent sense of direction.

**Low indicator:** Spends most time on work others could do. Feels pulled in directions that don't align with what matters. Has lost connection to why they started. Confuses being busy with being purposeful. Neglects personal development and relationships.

**Cost of ignoring:** A CEO without clear purpose makes decisions by default rather than by design. They drift into roles and responsibilities that don't match their strengths, building a company that succeeds financially but feels hollow personally. This is the most common driver of post-exit depression.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- Zone of Genius
- Kodawari (the spiritual pursuit of mastery)
- The Four Relationships
- The Dartboard Method
- Musashi's 22 Rules for Mastery

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Zone of Genius (identify where talent meets passion), Four Relationships (audit life balance)
- 40-70%: Dartboard Method (set goals that actually change your life), Kodawari (commit to craft)
- 70-100%: Musashi's 22 Rules (advanced mastery practice), Four Relationships (deepen)

---

### LY.5 PEAK PERFORMANCE (Sustain)

**Behavioral definition:** The discipline to protect capacity for deep work, manage energy strategically, and sustain excellence over decades rather than sprinting toward burnout.

**High indicator:** Regularly completes deep, uninterrupted work on highest priorities. Manages energy proactively (not just time). Has non-negotiable recovery practices. Says no to low-leverage activities. Operates near optimal stress levels, not too comfortable, not overwhelmed.

**Low indicator:** Calendar is 90% meetings and reactive tasks. Works through exhaustion. No boundaries between work and recovery. Optimizes for output volume rather than output quality. Has been "about to start taking care of myself" for months.

**Cost of ignoring:** Burnout doesn't arrive as exhaustion. It arrives as cynicism, detachment, and loss of meaning. CEOs who sacrifice sustainability for intensity lose 6-12 months of effective leadership when they inevitably crash, and the recovery period damages the organization more than the slower pace would have.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- Deep Work
- The 80:20 Rule
- Zürcher Resource Model (peak states on demand)
- The 5 Non-Negotiables
- Yerkes-Dodson Curve (stress design)

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: 5 Non-Negotiables (establish foundations), 80:20 (identify highest-leverage work)
- 40-70%: Deep Work (build protected blocks), Yerkes-Dodson (calibrate stress levels)
- 70-100%: ZRM (access peak states deliberately), Deep Work advanced (extend capacity)

---

### LT.1 BUILDING TRUST (Trust)

**Behavioral definition:** Creating the conditions where people feel safe enough to tell the truth, bring mistakes forward, and show vulnerability, because trust has been earned through consistent reliability, honesty, and genuine care.

**High indicator:** Team brings bad news early. Direct reports admit mistakes without fear. CEO follows through on commitments or renegotiates proactively. Says "I don't know" and "I was wrong" naturally. People believe the CEO has their genuine interests at heart.

**Low indicator:** Learns about problems through back channels or too late. People agree in meetings and disagree in hallways. Team members filter what they share. CEO overpromises and under-delivers. Trust is performative rather than felt.

**Cost of ignoring:** Without trust, everything else is theater. Meetings produce compliance, not truth. Feedback is sanitized. Decisions are made on incomplete information because people withhold what they think the CEO doesn't want to hear. The organization becomes a system optimized for managing the CEO's emotions rather than solving real problems.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The Trust Formula
- Turn Mistakes Into Trust (Four-Step Recovery)
- Lencioni's Pyramid (5 Dysfunctions foundation layer)
- Psychological Safety Framework

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Trust Formula (understand the components), Psychological Safety (assess the baseline)
- 40-70%: Mistakes into Trust (build repair skills), Lencioni's Pyramid (diagnose trust gaps)
- 70-100%: Psychological Safety (deepen and extend), Trust Formula (advanced: teach to team)

---

### LT.2 HARD CONVERSATIONS (Truth)

**Behavioral definition:** The ability to say what needs to be said, when it needs to be said, in a way that preserves the relationship while addressing the issue honestly.

**High indicator:** Addresses difficult topics within days, not months. Delivers feedback that lands without defensiveness. Listens to understand before responding. Can hold space for someone's pain without rescuing them from it. Team members feel challenged and supported simultaneously.

**Low indicator:** Avoids uncomfortable conversations for weeks or months. Feedback is either too blunt (damages relationship) or too soft (doesn't land). Listens to respond, not to understand. Uses "the timing isn't right" as a recurring excuse. Conversations that should take 10 minutes take 10 weeks of avoidance.

**Cost of ignoring:** Every difficult conversation you avoid becomes a more difficult conversation later. The 3-month delay turns a coaching conversation into a performance conversation into a termination conversation. Meanwhile, the rest of the team watches, and learns that avoidance is the cultural norm.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
- The 4 Ways of Listening
- The Honest Mirror Playbook (Feedback)
- Radical Candor

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: NVC basics (learn the structure), Radical Candor (understand the quadrants)
- 40-70%: 4 Ways of Listening (deepen receiving), Honest Mirror (improve feedback delivery)
- 70-100%: NVC advanced (real-time application), 4 Ways of Listening (generative listening)

---

### LT.3 DIAGNOSING THE REAL PROBLEM (Diagnosis)

**Behavioral definition:** The ability to see beneath surface symptoms to identify what's actually broken in your team, including your own contribution to the dysfunction.

**High indicator:** Asks questions that deepen thinking rather than jumping to solutions. Recognizes team dysfunction patterns (absence of trust → fear of conflict → lack of commitment → avoidance of accountability → inattention to results). Sees own role in team problems. Multiplies rather than diminishes team intelligence.

**Low indicator:** Gives answers faster than the team can think. Diagnoses every problem as a people problem or a process problem, never both. Creates dependency rather than capability. Team members come to the CEO for decisions they should make themselves. Treats symptoms repeatedly without addressing root causes.

**Cost of ignoring:** A CEO who can't diagnose team dysfunction accurately will cycle through the same interventions (hire better people, restructure, add a process) without resolving the underlying pattern. Meanwhile, the best people leave because they can feel that something is off, even if nobody names it.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team (diagnostic model)
- The 4 Relationship Killers (Gottman applied to work)
- The Self-Reliance Spiral
- The Multiplier Effect

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: 5 Dysfunctions (learn the diagnostic model), Self-Reliance Spiral (see your role)
- 40-70%: Multiplier Effect (shift from diminisher to multiplier), 4 Relationship Killers (recognize toxic patterns)
- 70-100%: 5 Dysfunctions advanced (facilitate team diagnosis), Multiplier (Liberator/Challenger mastery)

---

### LT.4 TEAM OPERATING SYSTEM (System)

**Behavioral definition:** The invisible rules, rhythms, meeting cadences, and accountability structures that define how your team actually works, designed deliberately rather than inherited by default.

**High indicator:** Has a consistent weekly leadership team meeting that produces decisions and accountability. Team knows what "good" looks like for meetings. Off-sites are designed for outcomes, not just bonding. Information flows to the right people at the right time. Decision rights are clear.

**Low indicator:** Meetings are unfocused, too frequent, or too rare. No consistent rhythm; everything is ad hoc. Off-sites are annual retreats with no follow-through. Information hoarding or information overload. Nobody is quite sure who decides what.

**Cost of ignoring:** Without an operating system, a team runs on heroics and habit. Everything depends on the CEO being in the room. Good people waste energy navigating ambiguity that should have been designed away. The team functions at 60% of its potential because the infrastructure for collaboration doesn't exist.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The 4 Meetings Framework
- Off-Site Design (5 Principles from 100+ Workshops)

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: 4 Meetings (establish the basic cadence)
- 40-70%: 4 Meetings advanced (optimize each meeting type), Off-Site Design (plan a transformative off-site)
- 70-100%: Off-Site Design mastery, custom rhythm development

---

### LT.5 LEADER IDENTITY (Identity)

**Behavioral definition:** Knowing where you end and your team begins. The shift from being the best individual contributor to being the person who builds the conditions for others to do their best work.

**High indicator:** Spends the majority of time working ON the team rather than IN the operations. Leadership team functions as genuine peers who co-lead, not as individual contributors who report upward. Has clearly let go of areas they used to own. Team prioritizes company results over departmental wins.

**Low indicator:** Still the smartest person in every room and acts like it. Leadership team relates to the CEO individually, not to each other. Takes back delegated work when quality drops. Identity is still "the person who does the work" rather than "the person who builds the team." Confuses management with leadership.

**Cost of ignoring:** This is the most common ceiling for scaling founders. The company cannot grow beyond what the CEO can personally oversee. Every new hire adds coordination cost rather than capacity because the organizational design still assumes the CEO is the hub of every spoke.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- Founder's Clarity Framework (Leadership vs. Management)
- The 3 Levels of High-Performing Organizations
- The Team One Principle

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Founder's Clarity (understand the distinction), 3 Levels (see what level you're operating at)
- 40-70%: Team One (reorient your leadership team), 3 Levels (move deliberately toward the right level)
- 70-100%: Team One mastery, Founder's Clarity advanced (design your evolved role)

---

### LO.1 STRATEGIC CLARITY (See)

**Behavioral definition:** The ability to make clear choices about where to play and how to win, and to use those choices as a daily decision filter that the entire organization can follow.

**High indicator:** Can articulate strategy in one sentence including what they're NOT doing. Declines off-strategy opportunities consistently. Team knows the top 3 priorities and can make decisions against them independently. Strategy is examined and refreshed regularly, not set and forgotten.

**Low indicator:** Strategy is vague ("be the best X") or absent. Pursues every opportunity. Team members can't articulate priorities consistently. Strategy exists in the CEO's head but hasn't been translated into operational choices. Confuses a business plan with a strategy.

**Cost of ignoring:** Without strategic clarity, an organization optimizes in every direction simultaneously, which means it optimizes in no direction. Resources are spread thin, teams make contradictory decisions, and the company wins by luck rather than by design. This is the silent killer of scaling companies.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- Organizational Maturity Analysis
- The 6 Strategy Traps
- Playing to Win
- Strategy Masks
- Drucker's Five Questions

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Drucker's Five Questions (start with basics), 6 Strategy Traps (know the pitfalls)
- 40-70%: Playing to Win (build strategic discipline), Strategy Masks (see through your own blind spots)
- 70-100%: Org Maturity Analysis (system-level view), Playing to Win advanced (cascade choices)

---

### LO.2 CULTURE DESIGN (Shape)

**Behavioral definition:** Designing culture as a system of specific, observable behaviors rather than aspirational values on a wall, and enforcing those behaviors even when it's costly.

**High indicator:** Culture is defined as behaviors, not abstract values. Addresses culture violations even from high performers. Hires and fires on cultural criteria, not just capability. Understands which of the four culture types their organization inhabits and whether it's the right one. Growth mindset is modeled, not just stated.

**Low indicator:** Values exist on the website but nobody references them in decisions. High performers get away with toxic behavior because they deliver results. Culture is "whatever happened" rather than "what we designed." Different teams have different cultures based on whoever leads them. New hires absorb norms by osmosis, not by design.

**Cost of ignoring:** Culture debt compounds like technical debt. Every month of tolerating misaligned behavior teaches the organization that stated values are fiction. The best culture-carriers leave. The most toxic high performers stay. Eventually, the median behavior in the company bears no resemblance to what the founder intended.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The 4 Cultures Model
- The Ajaz Spectrum of Inclusion
- Growth Mindset Cultures
- The Four Quadrants of Organizational Leadership
- Decision Architecture Playbook

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: 4 Cultures Model (diagnose current culture), Four Quadrants (find where the real problem lives)
- 40-70%: Growth Mindset (shift from fixed to growth), Decision Architecture (build behavioral systems)
- 70-100%: Inclusion Spectrum (advanced culture design), 4 Cultures advanced (deliberate culture evolution)

---

### LO.3 ORGANIZATIONAL ARCHITECTURE (Build)

**Behavioral definition:** Choosing and evolving the structures, roles, and systems that allow the organization to scale, matching design to strategy rather than inheriting design from the past.

**High indicator:** Organizational structure has been deliberately redesigned for current size and strategy. Roles are clear with defined decision rights. Continuous improvement is systematic, not episodic. Works effectively with external advisors without creating dependency.

**Low indicator:** Org chart reflects the company of 2 years ago. Roles overlap and decision rights are fuzzy. People work around the formal structure to get things done. Has never redesigned reporting lines or team structures. When something breaks, adds a person rather than fixing the design.

**Cost of ignoring:** Structure shapes behavior more than strategy does. A company with brilliant strategy and broken structure will execute poorly. People will consistently struggle, not because they lack talent, but because the organizational design creates friction, duplication, and confusion at every turn.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The Five Organizational Paradigms
- The Role Radar
- The Kaizen Method
- Consultant Readiness Playbook

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Five Paradigms (understand structural options), Role Radar (create role clarity)
- 40-70%: Role Radar advanced (decision rights mapping), Kaizen (build continuous improvement)
- 70-100%: Five Paradigms advanced (design for next stage), Consultant Readiness (leverage external expertise)

---

### LO.4 CEO EVOLUTION (Evolve)

**Behavioral definition:** The awareness that the version of you that built this company must evolve, and the willingness to let go of competencies and identities that no longer serve the organization's growth.

**High indicator:** Role looks meaningfully different from 12 months ago. Has successfully navigated at least one major identity transition (operator → manager → leader). Can leave for 2 weeks without the company breaking. Regularly assesses own fitness for the company's current needs. Seeks honest input on whether they're still the right CEO.

**Low indicator:** Doing the same work at 100 people as at 20. Hasn't let go of any functional area. Identity is still tied to the original role. Fears becoming irrelevant if they stop doing the work. Avoids the question of whether they're still the right leader for this stage.

**Cost of ignoring:** This is the most common reason good founders get replaced by their boards. Not because they lack intelligence or ambition, but because they couldn't evolve fast enough. The company outgrew the version of the CEO who built it, and the CEO couldn't see it happening.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The Three Transitions of Growing Organizations
- The Three Deaths of a CEO
- The Peter Principle Trap
- The CEO Test
- The 5 Criteria for CEO Success

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Three Transitions (understand where you are), CEO Test (honest self-assessment)
- 40-70%: Three Deaths (prepare for identity shifts), Peter Principle (spot your incompetence early)
- 70-100%: 5 Criteria for CEO Success (multiply impact), Three Deaths advanced (thrive through transitions)

---

### LO.5 LEADING CHANGE (Change)

**Behavioral definition:** The ability to manage risk intelligently, lead organizational transformation, maintain effective board governance, and protect what works while building what's next.

**High indicator:** Board relationship is characterized by candor and proactive communication. Balances exploitation of current strengths with exploration of new opportunities. Assesses risk systematically. Can lead organizational change without losing key people or momentum. Stakeholder management is deliberate.

**Low indicator:** Board meetings are performances. Risk is either ignored or paralyzing. Change initiatives are announced and abandoned. Treats board as adversary to manage rather than resource to leverage. Clings to what worked yesterday when the market has already moved.

**Cost of ignoring:** Companies that can't change die. But companies that change recklessly also die. The skill is holding both: protecting the core while extending into the new. CEOs who can't do this either stagnate into irrelevance or destroy value through unmanaged transformation.

**Konstantin Method frameworks:**
- The Onion Theory (risk reduction)
- The Ambidextrous Organization
- Board of Directors Excellence Playbook
- Transformation Readiness Playbook
- The Campaigning Playbook

**Framework prescription by score:**
- 0-40%: Onion Theory (understand risk layers), Board Excellence basics (fix the board relationship)
- 40-70%: Ambidextrous Organization (balance explore/exploit), Board Excellence advanced (leverage your board)
- 70-100%: Transformation Readiness (lead large-scale change), Campaigning (build internal momentum)

**B55** (R) [Freq] In the past 30 days, I caught myself or my leadership team confusing a business plan or list of initiatives with an actual strategy (a set of integrated choices about where to play and how to win).

### SITUATIONAL JUDGMENT ITEMS (SJI)

Each scenario presents a realistic CEO situation with four options. Options are labeled (a)-(d). Each maps to a behavioral tendency and receives a maturity score (1-4). The CEO also gets a behavioral profile tag per response, used for archetype detection.

**Scoring:** Each option receives a score of 1-4 for developmental maturity. Behavioral profile tags (Rescuer / Avoider / Controller / Facilitator) are tracked across all 15 SJIs to generate a secondary behavioral tendency map.

---

**SJ01 — Self-Awareness**
You're in a leadership team meeting. A direct report presents a proposal you immediately dislike. You notice your jaw tightening and an urge to shut it down. You:

(a) Voice your concerns directly and explain why it won't work. [Controller, 2]
(b) Ask the team what they think first, giving yourself time to examine your reaction. [Facilitator, 4]
(c) Stay quiet, planning to address it privately afterward. [Avoider, 1]
(d) Share that you're having a strong reaction and want to understand it before responding. [Facilitator, 3]

---

**SJ02 — Emotional Mastery**
Your co-founder just told you they're considering leaving. You feel a wave of anger, betrayal, and fear. You:

(a) Tell them you understand and ask them to take the weekend to think about it, while you do the same. [Facilitator, 4]
(b) Ask immediately what it would take for them to stay. [Rescuer, 2]
(c) Tell them how their leaving would affect the company and the team. [Controller, 1]
(d) Acknowledge the emotions you're feeling out loud and ask what's driving their consideration. [Facilitator, 3]

---

**SJ03 — Grounded Presence**
You've just received a threatening legal notice 30 minutes before an important all-hands meeting. Your team will read your energy. You:

(a) Postpone the all-hands to deal with the legal issue first. [Avoider, 2]
(b) Take 5 minutes alone to settle yourself, then run the all-hands as planned, addressing the legal issue separately afterward. [Facilitator, 4]
(c) Run the all-hands but mention the legal situation briefly so people don't sense unaddressed tension. [Controller, 3]
(d) Push through the all-hands, trusting yourself to compartmentalize. [Controller, 1]

---

**SJ04 — Purpose & Mastery**
A major investor offers you a board seat at a prestigious company. It would expand your network significantly but consume 10+ hours per month that currently go to deep work on your company and personal development. You:

(a) Accept immediately; the network benefits are too valuable to pass up. [Controller, 1]
(b) Decline; it doesn't align with your current priorities and would dilute your focus. [Facilitator, 3]
(c) Ask what specifically you'd contribute and how it connects to your own development as a leader, then decide. [Facilitator, 4]
(d) Accept but plan to reduce the time commitment once you're established. [Avoider, 2]

---

**SJ05 — Peak Performance**
It's Thursday evening. You've been in meetings since 8am. You have a strategic document to write that requires deep thinking, and the deadline is tomorrow morning. You:

(a) Power through tonight; you can rest this weekend. [Controller, 1]
(b) Send a message moving the deadline to Monday and go home. You know you won't produce your best work exhausted. [Facilitator, 4]
(c) Do a rough draft tonight and finish it fresh tomorrow morning before the meeting. [Facilitator, 3]
(d) Delegate it to someone on your team with a clear brief. [Avoider, 2]

---

**SJ06 — Building Trust**
During a 1-on-1, your VP of Engineering admits they shipped a feature with a known bug because they were afraid of missing the deadline you set. You:

(a) Thank them for telling you, then ask what about the dynamic between you made them feel the deadline was more important than quality. [Facilitator, 4]
(b) Reassure them that you value honesty and discuss how to fix the bug. [Rescuer, 3]
(c) Express disappointment that they didn't raise this earlier and set a new standard for flagging risks. [Controller, 2]
(d) Note it and move on; the bug can be fixed in the next sprint. [Avoider, 1]

---

**SJ07 — Hard Conversations**
Your Head of Sales has been underperforming for two quarters. You've hinted at concerns but haven't had a direct conversation. They seem unaware of the severity. A board member just asked about sales leadership. You:

(a) Have the direct conversation this week, acknowledging you should have raised it sooner, and set clear expectations with a timeline. [Facilitator, 4]
(b) Ask the board member for patience and plan to address it at the next quarterly review. [Avoider, 1]
(c) Hire a sales consultant to "support" the Head of Sales, hoping the consultant identifies and addresses the gap. [Avoider, 2]
(d) Have the conversation but focus on understanding what support they need before setting expectations. [Rescuer, 3]

---

**SJ08 — Diagnosing the Real Problem**
Your product team keeps missing sprint commitments. The engineering lead says they need more developers. The product lead says the scope keeps changing. They each blame the other's function. You:

(a) Hire more developers; if the engineering lead says they're under-resourced, that's probably true. [Rescuer, 1]
(b) Bring both leads together and facilitate a conversation where they diagnose the root cause together, including any contribution from your own decisions. [Facilitator, 4]
(c) Implement a more rigorous sprint planning process with stricter scope controls. [Controller, 2]
(d) Observe two sprint cycles without intervening, tracking where breakdowns actually occur, then share your diagnosis with both leads. [Facilitator, 3]

---

**SJ09 — Team Operating System**
You realize your leadership team meetings have become status update sessions. People share what's happening in their function but rarely make decisions, debate priorities, or hold each other accountable. You:

(a) Redesign the meeting format: pre-reads for status, meeting time reserved for decisions and debate. Announce the change and explain why. [Facilitator, 4]
(b) Raise it at the next meeting and ask the team to suggest improvements. [Facilitator, 3]
(c) Start attending less frequently, hoping the team will step up and make the meetings more productive without you. [Avoider, 1]
(d) Add a new monthly strategic meeting for "real" discussions and keep the weekly as-is. [Controller, 2]

---

**SJ10 — Leader Identity**
Your VP of Marketing presents a campaign direction you think is wrong. You have deep marketing experience from earlier in your career. You:

(a) Share your concerns, overrule the direction, and provide your recommended approach. [Controller, 1]
(b) Ask probing questions about the strategy and data behind the choice, then say "I trust your judgment, let's run with it" if the logic holds. [Facilitator, 4]
(c) Approve it but privately ask another team member to monitor the results. [Avoider, 2]
(d) Share your experience-based perspective, then ask the VP to weigh it against their analysis and make the final call. [Facilitator, 3]

---

**SJ11 — Strategic Clarity**
A large potential customer offers a lucrative deal, but serving them would require building a feature set that pulls your product team away from your core strategic direction for 6+ months. The revenue would cover two quarters of burn. You:

(a) Take the deal; the revenue provides runway and optionality. [Controller, 1]
(b) Decline the deal. The strategic cost outweighs the financial benefit. [Facilitator, 3]
(c) Propose a limited version of the engagement that serves the customer without derailing your roadmap, and be willing to walk away if they won't accept it. [Facilitator, 4]
(d) Take the deal but plan to return to the strategic roadmap once the engagement ends. [Avoider, 2]

---

**SJ12 — Culture Design**
Your best salesperson consistently hits 150% of quota. They're also dismissive to support staff, take credit for team efforts, and several people have quietly complained. You:

(a) Have a direct conversation: their behavior violates cultural expectations and must change regardless of their sales numbers, with clear consequences if it doesn't. [Facilitator, 4]
(b) Pair them with a coach to work on interpersonal skills. [Rescuer, 2]
(c) Raise it gently in their next performance review alongside their strong numbers. [Avoider, 1]
(d) Move them to a role with less team interaction so their talent is preserved but their impact on culture is reduced. [Controller, 3]

---

**SJ13 — Organizational Architecture**
Your company has doubled to 120 people, but the org structure hasn't changed since you were 60. Decision-making is slow, teams step on each other's work, and middle managers escalate everything. You:

(a) Add a COO to sort out the operational complexity. [Rescuer, 2]
(b) Block a full day to map current decision bottlenecks and overlaps, then redesign the structure with your leadership team based on your current strategy and the decisions that need to be made. [Facilitator, 4]
(c) Ask each department head to propose structural improvements for their area. [Facilitator, 3]
(d) Implement a project management tool and clearer processes within the existing structure. [Controller, 1]

---

**SJ14 — CEO Evolution**
You realize that the company needs a world-class CFO for the next funding round, but you've been handling finance yourself since founding. A board member suggests that your involvement in finance is creating a bottleneck. You:

(a) Agree it's time and begin a search immediately, committing to a full handover. [Facilitator, 4]
(b) Agree in principle but decide to wait until after the current quarter closes. [Avoider, 2]
(c) Hire a Head of Finance but keep final approval on all major financial decisions during a transition period. [Controller, 3]
(d) Push back; you know the numbers better than anyone and an outsider would take months to ramp up. [Controller, 1]

---

**SJ15 — Leading Change**
Your company needs to pivot its go-to-market strategy. This will affect every team, require letting go of some customers, and create 3-6 months of uncertainty. Your board supports the direction. You:

(a) Announce the pivot to the entire company at the next all-hands with a clear rationale and timeline. [Controller, 2]
(b) Roll it out in phases: align the leadership team first, develop a communication plan together, then cascade to the organization with each leader owning their team's transition. [Facilitator, 4]
(c) Start implementing changes quietly in one team as a pilot before announcing company-wide. [Avoider, 1]
(d) Share the strategic rationale with the full company and create structured forums for questions, concerns, and input before finalizing the implementation plan. [Facilitator, 3]

---

### IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT ITEMS (IM)

These items detect socially desirable responding. They describe behaviors that sound reasonable but are implausibly consistent when claimed as "almost always."

**Scoring:** Response of 4 or 5 = 1 (implausibly positive). Response of 1-3 = 0 (realistic). Total IM score of 4+ (out of 6) triggers validity flag.

**IM01** [Freq] When I receive feedback I disagree with, I carefully consider it before responding.

**IM02** [Freq] In meetings, I make sure everyone has a chance to speak before sharing my own opinion.

**IM03** [Freq] When someone on my team makes an error, I focus entirely on how to fix it rather than feeling any frustration.

**IM05** [Freq] When I'm under extreme pressure, I remain completely calm and clearheaded.

**IM06** [Freq] I give equal weight to every person's input, regardless of their seniority or my prior opinion of their judgment.

---

### MIRROR CHECK ITEMS (Add-On)

One item per dimension, answered by a trusted rater (direct report, co-founder, chief of staff, or board member) about the CEO. Uses the same response scales.

The rater receives this framing: *"Please answer based on what you actually observe, not what [CEO name] intends or aspires to. There are no right answers. Your honest perspective is the most valuable thing you can provide."*

**M01 — Self-Awareness** [Freq] In the past 30 days, when this leader had a strong reaction, they noticed it and adjusted their behavior rather than being driven by it.

**M02 — Emotional Mastery** [Freq] In the past 30 days, this leader expressed difficult emotions (frustration, disappointment, concern) in a way that was honest but not harmful.

**M03 — Grounded Presence** [Freq] In the past 30 days, when I spoke with this leader during important conversations, they were genuinely present and attentive.

**M04 — Purpose & Mastery** [Deg] This leader seems to be doing work that aligns with their deepest strengths, rather than getting pulled into tasks others could handle.

**M05 — Peak Performance** [Freq] In the past 30 days, this leader appeared to be managing their energy and workload sustainably, rather than running on fumes.

**M06 — Building Trust** [Freq] In the past 30 days, I felt comfortable bringing this leader bad news or admitting a mistake without fearing a negative reaction.

**M07 — Hard Conversations** [Freq] In the past 30 days, when this leader needed to address a difficult topic, they did so directly and in a timely way.

**M08 — Diagnosing the Real Problem** [Freq] In the past 30 days, when I brought this leader a problem, they asked questions to understand before offering solutions.

**M09 — Team Operating System** [Deg] Our team currently has clear, effective rhythms (meetings, check-ins, decision processes) that help us collaborate well.

**M10 — Leader Identity** [Freq] In the past 30 days, this leader empowered the team to make decisions rather than keeping control.

**M11 — Strategic Clarity** [Deg] I can clearly articulate our company's strategic priorities and use them to guide my own decisions.

**M12 — Culture Design** [Freq] In the past 30 days, this leader addressed behavior that went against our culture, even when the person involved was a strong performer.

**M13 — Organizational Architecture** [Deg] In my experience, decision rights and roles in this organization are clear enough that I rarely need to escalate or work around the structure.

**M14 — CEO Evolution** [Deg] This leader has visibly evolved their role to match the company's current needs rather than holding onto responsibilities from an earlier stage.

**M15 — Leading Change** [Freq] In the past 30 days, this leader communicated openly with stakeholders (board, investors, team) about challenges and uncertainties, not just successes.

## SCORING ARCHITECTURE

### Sub-Dimension Composite Score

For each of the 15 dimensions:

1. **Behavioral score:** Mean of 5 items (reverse-scored items inverted: new_score = 6 - raw_score). Range: 1.0-5.0
2. **SJI score:** Single item, scored 1-4, rescaled to 1.0-5.0 (formula: (raw - 1) × 1.33 + 1)
3. **Composite:** 70% behavioral + 30% SJI
4. **Converted to 0-100% scale:** (composite - 1) / 4 × 100

### Verbal Labels

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0-20% | Critical gap | This dimension is likely causing visible problems now |
| 21-40% | Early development | Awareness exists but behavior hasn't shifted consistently |
| 41-60% | Building | Active development; inconsistent but trending upward |
| 61-80% | Strong | Consistent behavior; room for refinement |
| 81-100% | Mastery | Rare; consistent excellence others can observe |

### Territory Score

Each territory = mean of its 5 dimension composites.

### CLMI (CEO Leadership Maturity Index)

CLMI = mean of 3 territory scores.

### Impression Management

IM score = sum of items scored 1 (implausibly positive response). Range: 0-6.
- IM 0-3: No flag
- IM 4-6: Validity flag. Report message: "Your responses suggest a tendency to present an idealized picture. This assessment is most valuable when answered with radical honesty. Consider retaking with the intent to describe your actual behavior, not your aspirations."

IM score is NOT included in the CLMI.

### Mirror Check Gaps

For each dimension: Gap = CEO self-score - Rater score.
- 0 to 0.5: Aligned perception
- 0.5 to 1.0: Mild blind spot
- 1.0 to 1.5: Significant blind spot
- 1.5+: Critical blind spot (flag for coaching)
- Negative gap (rater scores higher): Possible under-confidence or imposter syndrome

---

## STAGING DESIGN

### Stage 1: Engage (~32 items, ~15 minutes)
Purpose: Front-load engaging SJI content alongside anchor items to maximize completion.

- 15 behavioral items (1st item per dimension: B01, B06, B11, B16, B21, B26, B31, B36, B41, B46, B51, B56, B61, B66, B71)
- 11 SJI items (SJ01-SJ11)
- 6 IM items (IM01-IM06)
- Total: 32

### Stage 2: Deepen (~34 items, ~15 minutes)
Purpose: Expand measurement with second and third items per dimension plus remaining SJIs.

- 30 behavioral items (2nd and 3rd items per dimension)
- 4 SJI items (SJ12-SJ15)
- Total: 34

### Stage 3: Complete (~30 items, ~12 minutes)
Purpose: Pure behavioral depth for maximum psychometric reliability.

- 30 behavioral items (4th and 5th items per dimension)
- Total: 30

**Grand total: 96 items**

Items randomized within stages across dimensions (never blocked by dimension to prevent halo effects).

## PILOT PLAN

### Phase 1: Expert Review (Week 1)
Niko reviews all 96 items against 5 quality criteria:
1. Behavioral (measures action, not knowledge)
2. Realistic (CEO encounters this monthly+)
3. Sensitive (would change with 90 days of practice)
4. Non-obvious (can't identify "right" answer instantly)
5. Jargon-free (no framework names, no coaching language)

### Phase 2: CEO Language Review (Week 2)
5-8 CEOs from target audience review all items. For each: Is this clear? Is this relevant to your reality? Could you answer this honestly?

### Phase 3: Instrument Lock (Week 3)
Revise flagged items. Lock pilot instrument.

### Phase 4: Pilot Data Collection (Weeks 4-7)
Recruit 50-80 CEOs via newsletter, LinkedIn, and direct outreach.
Incentive: 3 months free CEO Lab access + 30-minute debrief call.

### Phase 5: Analysis (Weeks 8-9)
| Metric | Target | Action if Missed |
|---|---|---|
| Cronbach's α per dimension | ≥ .70 | Drop weakest item, revise remaining |
| Item-total correlation | r ≥ .30 per item | Drop or revise item |
| Response distribution | No single option > 60% | Revise anchors or rewrite item |
| Dimension mean | Between 2.0 and 4.0 | Recalibrate anchors |
| Dimension SD | ≥ 0.60 | Item not differentiating; revise |
| SJI option distribution | No option > 50% | Revise options |
| IM mean | < 2.0 | Items too obvious; revise |
| IM-CLMI correlation | r < .40 | Assessment too gameable |
| Mirror Check self-other correlation | r = .20-.50 | Below .20 = different constructs; above .50 = suspicious |
| Stage 1→2 completion rate | ≥ 70% | Stage 1 too long or not engaging |
| Stage 2→3 completion rate | ≥ 80% | Stage 2 fatigue; consider shortening |

### Phase 6: Production Lock (Week 10)
Trim underperforming items (target: keep 4 per dimension, 5 for highest-risk). Lock production instrument.
