# CEO Lab Launch Plan
### The Lean Playbook: €100K in 30 Days, Zero Ads

---

## The Approach

Our advantage is the same as Kleo's, but more potent: Nikolas already has distribution (LinkedIn), owned traffic (The Mindful CEO newsletter), and a high-trust audience of CEOs. We don't need to build from scratch. We need to activate what already exists.

The key difference: Kleo sells volume at $39/month. We sell transformation at €100/month. That means our launch needs to feel like an invitation, not a campaign.

Here's the 30-day playbook.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Build (Weeks 1-2, before any public mention)

**Build the product with your users, not for them.**

1. Identify 15-20 warm contacts (newsletter subscribers, past workshop attendees, people who've engaged on LinkedIn but aren't coaching clients)
2. Send a personal voice note or short email: "I'm building something new. Would love your eyes on it before anyone else sees it."
3. Give them free access to the V1 (5 core assessments, dashboard, AI analysis)
4. Collect feedback weekly. Fix, test, iterate.
5. Ask one question: "Would you pay €100/month for this?" Listen carefully.

**Naval principle:** "If you can't sell 10, you can't sell 10,000. Start with 10."

**Deliverable:** 15 beta users, 3 written testimonials, 1 case study draft.

---

## Phase 1: Seed the Idea (Days 1-7)

**Turn LinkedIn into a distribution engine for the problem CEO Lab solves.**

Do NOT mention CEO Lab. Instead, publish content that makes the audience feel the problem.

**Day 1 (Monday):** Post about blind spots and self-awareness.

Hook: "Most CEOs read 30 leadership books a year. Almost none of them measure whether they're actually growing."

Angle: The gap between consuming leadership content and actually developing as a leader. You read about emotional intelligence, but do you know your score? You talk about delegation, but has your trust with your team improved since Q1?

**Day 3 (Wednesday):** Post about what your coaching clients get that others don't.

Hook: "The thing my clients value most isn't my advice. It's the mirror."

Angle: Regular assessment, honest feedback loops, and watching your own evolution over time. Most founders fly blind.

**Day 5 (Friday):** Personal post about why you're building something new.

Hook: "I've spent 5 years coaching CEOs at €50K+ a year. And I kept thinking: what about the founders who aren't there yet?"

Angle: The realization that the frameworks, assessments, and tools you use in 1:1 coaching could be made available at scale. Not watered down. Just delivered differently.

**Newsletter (end of week):** Essay in The Mindful CEO about "The Case for Measuring Your Leadership." No CTA, no pitch. Pure thought leadership. Plant the seed.

---

## Phase 2: Build the Waitlist (Days 8-14)

**Turn interest into owned traffic.**

**Day 8 (Monday):** The reveal post.

Hook: "I'm building CEO Lab."

Structure:
- One line on what it is (monthly leadership assessments + AI analysis + frameworks library + meditation app)
- One line on who it's for (founders who want to grow but aren't ready for a €50K coaching engagement)
- One line on the price (€100/month or €1,000/year)
- CTA: "If you want early access, drop a comment or send me a message. First 50 members get founding member pricing."

**Day 10 (Wednesday):** Share a screenshot of the assessment dashboard with real (anonymized) data.

Hook: "This is what leadership growth looks like when you actually measure it."

Show the AI analysis output. Make it tangible. Let people see what they'd get.

**Day 12 (Friday):** Social proof post.

Hook: "I shared CEO Lab with 15 founders last month. Here's what they said."

Share 2-3 beta tester quotes. Real names if possible.

**Newsletter:** "Why I Built CEO Lab" essay. Link to waitlist. Personal, honest, zero hype.

**Email to full list:** Separate from newsletter. Subject: "Something new." Short, personal email announcing CEO Lab with waitlist link.

---

## Phase 3: Warm the List (Days 15-21)

**Weekly emails to everyone on the waitlist. Build anticipation without being salesy.**

**Email 1 (Day 15):** "Here's exactly what's inside CEO Lab." Walk through the 5 launch assessments. Explain the AI analysis. Show a sample monthly report.

**Email 2 (Day 18):** "The story behind the Zone of Genius assessment." Pick one assessment and go deep. Show the intellectual rigor. Make it feel like a preview of the product.

**Email 3 (Day 21):** "CEO Lab opens in 7 days. Here's the founding member offer." Create a clear founding member tier: first 50 members lock in €80/month for life (or €800/year). This isn't a discount, it's a thank you for being early.

**LinkedIn this week:** Continue posting about the themes (blind spots, measurement, self-awareness) but now mention CEO Lab by name. Share behind-the-scenes of the build process. One post showing you working on the product. One post sharing an insight from a beta tester.

---

## Phase 4: Launch Week (Days 22-28)

**This is your "webinar + one-time offer" equivalent, adapted for your positioning.**

**Day 22 (Monday): Doors Open post.**

Hook: "CEO Lab is live."

Simple, clean. What it is. What's inside. Price. Link. Founding member offer (50 spots at €80/month).

**Day 23 (Tuesday): Email to full list.** "Doors are open." Same message, more personal.

**Day 24 (Wednesday): LinkedIn Live or short video.**

Not a webinar (too salesy for your brand). Instead: a 20-minute "Inside CEO Lab" walkthrough.

- Show the platform live
- Walk through one assessment in real time
- Show the AI analysis
- Take 3-4 questions
- End with: "If this is for you, the link is in the comments."

**Day 25 (Thursday): Email to waitlist only.** "24 founding member spots remaining." (Only send if true.)

**Day 26 (Friday): Social proof post.** Share first-day signups, early member reactions, or a screenshot of the member count. Keep it real, not performative.

**Day 28 (Sunday): Final email.** "Founding member pricing closes tomorrow." Last chance. Clean, no pressure.

---

## Phase 5: Close + Compound (Days 29-30)

**Day 29 (Monday):** Founding member pricing closes. Post a simple "thank you" on LinkedIn. Share the number of members. Be genuinely grateful.

**Day 30:** Shift to ongoing content mode. CEO Lab becomes a permanent part of the content calendar. One post per week references it naturally (insights from the assessments, member stories, framework previews).

---

## Revenue Projections

| Scenario | Members | Monthly Revenue | Annual Run Rate |
|----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | 30 | €3,000 | €36,000 |
| Moderate | 75 | €7,500 | €90,000 |
| Aggressive | 150 | €15,000 | €180,000 |

**Founding member math:** 50 founding members at €80/month = €4,000/month = €48,000/year locked in before general pricing kicks in.

---

## What We Don't Do

This is just as important as the plan:

- **No paid ads.** Our distribution is organic. Period.
- **No influencer partnerships.** We are the brand. No one else speaks for Nikolas.
- **No fake urgency.** "Limited spots" only if genuinely limited. No countdown timers.
- **No "DM me GROWTH" nonsense.** The CTA is always a link or a comment, never a keyword game.
- **No discounting after launch.** Founding member pricing is the only discount, ever.
- **No comparison to competitors.** CEO Lab stands on its own value, not against others.

## The 8-Step Parallel to Kleo

| Kleo's Approach | CEO Lab Equivalent |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1. Build distribution first (organic LinkedIn) | Already built: 2,500+ newsletter subscribers, LinkedIn presence |
| 2. Turn into owned traffic (waitlist) | Newsletter + dedicated waitlist page |
| 3. Build product with users (early access) | 15-20 beta testers in Phase 0 |
| 4. Fix, test, iterate every week | Weekly feedback loops with beta group |
| 5. Pick a launch date and promote | Day 22 launch, 2 weeks of pre-launch content |
| 6. Weekly emails to warm list | 3 pre-launch emails + newsletter essays |
| 7. Promotion sequence for launch week | 4-day launch sequence (Mon-Thu) |
| 8. Webinar + one-time offer | LinkedIn Live walkthrough + founding member pricing |

---

## Key Metrics to Track

**Pre-launch:**
- Waitlist signups (target: 200+)
- Email open rates on pre-launch sequence (target: 40%+)
- LinkedIn post engagement on CEO Lab content

**Launch week:**
- Conversion rate: waitlist to paid (target: 15-25%)
- Founding member spots filled (target: 50)
- Revenue Day 1, Day 7, Day 30

**Post-launch:**
- Monthly churn rate (target: under 5%)
- Net Promoter Score from members
- Conversion to higher-tier offerings (coaching, Fellowship)

## One Last Thing

Lara Acosta's real insight isn't the 8 steps. It's this: **she became her own distribution channel.** She didn't outsource trust. She didn't buy attention. She earned it, daily, with content that made people think.

You've been doing that for years. CEO Lab is simply the next logical step for the thousands of people who read your posts, nod along, and think: "I wish I could work with this person."

Now they can. At €100/month instead of €50,000/year.

That's the pitch. Keep it that simple.
