# CEO Lab - Phase 0: Beta Outreach

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** Ready to send (pending prototype sign-off)

---

## Goal

Get 15-20 warm contacts into the product before any public mention. Come out of Phase 0 with: 3 written testimonials, 1 case study draft, and a clear "yes, I'd pay for this" signal.

---

## Who to Contact

**Criteria (all 3 must apply):**
1. You know them — newsletter reader, workshop attendee, LinkedIn engager, former collaborator
2. They're in the target persona — founder, CEO, or managing director running a team
3. They are NOT a current 1:1 coaching client (avoid demand effects)

**Ideal profiles:**
- Series A/B founder who follows your content but hasn't worked with you directly
- Technical founder now leading a team (engineering background, now wearing the CEO hat)
- Solo entrepreneur doing €200k+ who takes their own development seriously
- Someone who's commented on your LinkedIn posts about leadership, blind spots, or growth

**Avoid:**
- Close friends who'll say yes to anything (skewed feedback)
- People who'll ghost (only invite high-trust contacts)
- Active coaching clients

## Outreach Message — Email

**Subject:** A favour (and something new)

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm building something I've wanted to build for a while — and before I show it to anyone else, I'd love your eyes on it.

It's called CEO Lab. The short version: it measures your leadership the way a fitness tracker measures your health. Baseline assessment, weekly check-ins, a dashboard that shows you whether you're actually improving — built on the same frameworks I use in my 1:1 coaching work.

I'm testing it with a small group before launch. Free access, no catch. I'd just ask two things: use it for 2-3 weeks, and tell me honestly what works and what doesn't.

One question I'm trying to answer: would you pay €100/month for this?

If you're up for it, reply and I'll send you a link.

## Outreach Message — Voice Note Script

*(Keep it under 60 seconds. Conversational, not scripted.)*

"Hey [Name], Nikolas here. Quick voice note — I'm building something new and I wanted to ask you personally before I put it out publicly.

It's a leadership measurement platform. Think fitness tracker, but for how you're developing as a CEO. Baseline assessment, weekly tracking, dashboard.

I'm testing it with about 15 people before launch, giving them free access. Takes maybe 40 minutes to set up, then 5 minutes a week. The only ask is honest feedback — what lands, what doesn't.

Would you be up for it? Just reply and I'll send you a link."

---

## Feedback System

### Week 1 — After they complete the baseline assessment

Send a short message (WhatsApp or email):

> "You're in — great. Three quick questions once you've gone through the baseline:
> 1. What surprised you most about your results?
> 2. Was anything confusing or unclear?
> 3. Did the report feel useful, or more like a personality test?"

### Week 2 — After their first weekly check-in

> "How did the weekly check-in feel? Too long, too short, about right?"

### Week 3 — The honest conversation

This one is a 15-minute call or a longer voice note exchange. Ask:

1. **The key question:** "If this were €100/month, would you pay for it? Why or why not?"
2. "What's the single most valuable thing you got from it?"
3. "What would make you stop using it after month 1?"
4. "Is there anyone else you'd send this to? What would you tell them about it?"

## Testimonial Capture

After the Week 3 conversation, if the feedback is positive, ask directly:

> "This is really helpful — would you be comfortable putting that in writing? Even 2-3 sentences. I'll be sharing early reactions when I launch publicly and I'd love to include yours."

**What makes a good testimonial:**
- Specific (names a dimension, a result, a shift)
- Honest (not generic "great tool!")
- From someone with a name and a title you can use

**Template to give them if they're stuck:**

> "Before CEO Lab, I had a sense of where I was struggling but no real way to measure it. The [dimension] score hit hard — I hadn't realised how much it was affecting my team. Three weeks in, I'm tracking it weekly. That visibility alone is worth it."
