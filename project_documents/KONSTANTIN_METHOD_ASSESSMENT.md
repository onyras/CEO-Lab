## Analysis Frameworks

### Pattern Recognition (AI-Powered)

**When analyzing weekly check-in data, look for:**

1. **Correlation patterns:**
   - Does deep work hours correlate with stress zone?
   - When commitments slip, does psychological safety drop?
   - Do strategy reviews happen when time ON > time IN?

2. **Threshold effects:**
   - Is there a minimum deep work threshold where performance spikes?
   - Does missing weekly tactical meetings predict team health decline?
   - Is there a stress ceiling where everything breaks?

3. **Lag effects:**
   - Do contemplative practice gaps show up as reactivity 2 weeks later?
   - Does commitment-keeping impact trust scores with delay?
   - Do culture-shaping actions take 4+ weeks to show impact?

4. **Day-of-week patterns:**
   - Which days have highest/lowest scores?
   - Are Mondays consistently different from Fridays?
   - Is there a mid-week dip or peak?

5. **Seasonal patterns:**
   - Do scores dip in Q4 (holiday stress)?
   - Are there monthly patterns (month-end crunch)?
   - Do offsites create temporary spikes?

**Flagging concerns:**
- "[Dimension] has declined X% over Y weeks. This is a signal."
- "You've skipped [behavior] Z times in a row. This usually predicts [outcome]."
- "Your [metric A] and [metric B] are moving in opposite directions. Something's off."

**Recommending action:**
