## DOCUMENT 1: HOW TO SIMPLIFY HITTING YOUR BIGGEST GOAL: THE HARADA METHOD

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to simplify hitting your biggest goal: The Harada Method  
The 64-Cell Method: How One Founder Turned Chaos Into Clarity  
"I feel like I'm drowning."  
Sarah sat across from me, her third coffee of the morning growing cold between us. She'd built her fintech startup to 35 employees and $4M ARR, but success had become its own trap.  
"Every day is reactive," she continued. "Investor asks, my co-founder creates chaos,and i just keep cleaning up. I know we need to raise our Series A, but I can't even find time to update our deck. I'm not leading anymore. I'm just... surviving."  
I pulled out a blank sheet of paper and drew a simple grid.  
"What if we could turn that Series A raise from a mountain you're climbing into simple daily practices you're executing?"  
The Method That Changes Everything  
The 64-Cell Method, pioneered by Japanese coach Takashi Harada and made famous by baseball player Shohei Ohtani, does something remarkable: it transforms audacious goals into daily habits.  
Here's how it works:  
Center Cell: Your one essential goal  
8 Pillars: The key areas that support that goal  
64 Actions: Eight specific practices for each pillar  
The magic isn't in the structure. It's in what the structure reveals: the exact gap between your current daily habits and your desired outcome.  
Sarah's Grid Takes Shape  
"Series A closed by year-end," Sarah wrote in the center cell. Six months away.  
"Now," I asked, "what eight areas need to be strong for investors to say yes?"  
She thought for a moment, then wrote:  
Financial Performance  
Team Strength  
Product-Market Fit  
Personal Leadership  
Investor Relations  
Operations Excellence  
Customer Success  
Strategic Vision  
"Good. Now here's where it gets interesting. For each pillar, what are eight specific, controllable actions you could take?"  
The Revelation in the Details  
Under "Personal Leadership," Sarah started with the predictable: "Executive coaching," "Leadership training," "Better delegation."  
"What else?" I pushed. "What small daily practices would make you the leader this company needs?"  
She paused, then kept writing:  
First one in office on Mondays  
Weekly handwritten note to one team member  
15-minute walking meetings for difficult conversations  
Phone in drawer during team meetings  
Share one vulnerability in all-hands  
End each day by texting tomorrow's priority to myself  
"These feel... small," she said.  
"Exactly."  
The Karma Column  
When we got to "Investor Relations," Sarah surprised herself. Beyond "Update monthly metrics" and "Expand network," she wrote:  
Send one thank-you note weekly (even to people who said no)  
Share other founders' wins on LinkedIn  
Offer help before asking for intros  
Remember birthdays of key contacts  
"This isn't how I usually think about fundraising," she admitted.  
"That's why it works. You're not trying to convince investors. You're becoming someone worth investing in."  
From Grid to Daily Practice  
The completed grid contained everything from "Review P\&L every Monday at 9am" to "Eat lunch away from desk" to "Call one customer personally each week."  
Sixty-four cells. Sixty-four practices.  
We turned it into a simple daily tracking sheet. Not every action happened daily; some were weekly, others triggers for specific situations. But each had its place and rhythm.  
"This is still a lot," Sarah said, looking at the complete grid.  
"It is. But is it more than you're already doing?"  
She laughed. "No. It's just... organized. Intentional."  
Six Weeks Later  
"I closed two angels yesterday," Sarah's email read. "But that's not the real news."  
She'd been executing her 64 practices for six weeks. The changes were subtle but compounding:  
Morning financial reviews revealed a pricing opportunity that increased MRR by 15%  
Weekly customer calls uncovered three powerful case studies  
Her "vulnerability shares" at all-hands moved the needle on team culture  
"I'm not drowning anymore," she wrote. "I'm building."  
The Deeper Pattern  
Sarah's story reveals what makes the 64-Cell Method powerful: it doesn't add complexity to your life; it adds structure to complexity that already exists.  
Most founders are already doing 100+ things daily. The method simply asks: Are they the right things? Do they ladder up to what matters? Are you being as intentional about picking up trash (literally or metaphorically) as you are about strategic planning?  
Your Turn to Build  
The method starts with honest questions:  
What one goal, if achieved, would change everything?  
What eight areas must be strong for that goal to happen?  
For each area, what eight specific practices would move you forward?  
The framework is simple enough to sketch on a napkin but profound enough to change your trajectory.  
The Unexpected Magic  
Three months into her practice, Sarah sent me a photo of her grid. She'd highlighted certain cells in yellow.  
"These are the ones that seemed stupid when I wrote them," she explained. "Taking walking meetings. Writing thank-you notes. Eating lunch away from my desk. But they've changed everything. They created space. They built relationships. They made me someone people want to help."  
She closed her Series A two weeks ahead of schedule. But more importantly, she'd become the leader her company needed: not through some dramatic transformation but through 64 small, daily practices, compounding over time.  
The Practice Begins Today  
Your biggest challenge right now likely feels overwhelming because you're viewing it as one massive goal rather than 64 daily practices.  
The grid won't make it easy. But it will make it specific. It will turn "someday" into "what I do today at 3pm." It will transform hope into method.  
Draw your grid. Fill your cells. Begin your practice.  
Because the distance between where you are and where you want to be isn't measured in miles. It's measured in daily repetitions, small choices, tiny habits that seem insignificant but compound into inevitability.  
Sarah's drowning feeling? It never fully goes away for founders. But now she has a boat, oars, and a map.  
Your 64 cells are waiting. What will you put in the center?  
In kindness,   
Nikolas

—----  
Shohei Ohtani didn’t just “work hard.”  
At 15, he sat down with a blank 8×8 grid and designed his future.  
In the center square, he wrote something almost absurdly ambitious for a skinny high school pitcher:  
“Be the \#1 draft pick for all 8 NPB teams.”  
Every other box on that page existed for one purpose: make that sentence inevitable.  
That grid was based on the Harada Method—a deceptively simple system for turning huge, intimidating dreams into concrete daily behavior.  
And it has a lot to say to founders and CEOs who feel they’re carrying a company on their backs with nothing but Slack, a board deck, and mild existential dread.  
The origins: from last place to first  
The Harada Method was created by Takashi Harada, a junior high school track coach in Osaka.  
His team was ranked 380th out of 380 schools. Dead last. Within three years of applying his system, they were ranked \#1 in their region—and they stayed there for six years.  
This wasn’t because Harada discovered a new training drill. He discovered a new way for young people to take ownership of their goals.  
The essence:  
Pick one clear, concrete goal.  
Break it into 8 critical pillars.  
Break each pillar into 8 small, trainable habits.  
Then live inside that grid every day.  
Ohtani did exactly that.  
Ohtani’s 8×8: a blueprint for world-class performance  
At the center of his 64-box “dream sheet”:  
“Get drafted 1st overall (8 teams)”  
Around it, he placed 8 supporting pillars—what he believed he had to systematically cultivate to make that dream non-negotiable:  
Body  
Control  
Sharpness  
Speed  
Pitch Variance  
Personality  
Karma / Luck  
Mental Toughness  
Already, that’s striking.  
Most people would stop at: body, speed, control, pitch variance—the obvious technical stack. Ohtani layered in:  
Personality – how he shows up in the clubhouse.  
Karma/Luck – how he relates to umpires, teammates, the environment.  
Mental Toughness – how he stays steady when everything gets loud.  
Inside each pillar, he wrote 8 specific behaviors.  
For karma, that included things like:  
“Show respect to umpires.”  
“Pick up trash.”  
“Be positive.”  
“Be someone people want to support.”  
There is something profoundly non-Western and deeply wise about this:  
Success isn’t only about what you do, it’s about the field you create around you.  
The Harada grid simply forces you to make that visible.  
Why this works (psychology, neuroscience, and a bit of Buddhism)  
There are at least four powerful mechanisms at play here:  
1\. From fantasy to responsibility  
“Be the \#1 draft pick” is fantasy-level for a teenager.  
“Improve core strength”, “eat three proper meals”, “practice fastball form for all pitches” is not.  
The Harada Method compresses the distance between outcome and agency.  
You move from “I hope” to “If I do these things daily, I increase the probability curve in my favor.”  
In psychological language: it builds an internal locus of control.  
2\. The brain loves small, specific actions  
Neuroscience of habit formation is blunt: vague intentions don’t train neural pathways. Repeated, specific actions do.  
“Be mentally tougher” is inspirational.  
“Don’t get caught up in the flow of the game; come back to the next pitch” is trainable.  
Each of the 64 cells becomes a neural groove you’re deliberately etching.  
3\. Metacognition on paper  
The grid is a mirror. It externalizes Ohtani’s self-assessment:  
Where am I weak?  
Where am I avoiding discomfort?  
Where am I over-invested in talent and under-invested in character?  
This is metacognition—thinking about how you think and act—in highly practical form.  
4\. Ethics as a performance technology  
The “karma” and “service” squares could be dismissed as superstition.  
Or you can see them as a sophisticated insight: outcomes emerge from systems of relationship. If you are the kind of person people quietly want to help, your probability space changes.  
In Buddhist terms, intention and action plant seeds; over time, they ripen as conditions. The Harada grid simply puts those seeds in the same frame as “core strength” and “sharpen slider.”  
What this has to do with you as a CEO  
Most founders I work with carry something like their own central square:  
“Reach €10M ARR.”  
“Become the category leader in X.”  
“Build a company I don’t secretly resent.”  
But their actual “grid” lives as:  
An anxious swirl of Notion docs.  
A strategy offsite memo.  
A few todo lists and regrets.  
It’s rarely one page you can point at and say:  
“If I practice these 64 behaviors, I’m actively building the person and the company that can hold that goal.”  
So let’s translate Ohtani’s 8×8 into your world.  
Step 1: Put one uncompromising goal in the middle  
Not five.  
Not a vague “grow meaningfully” or “build a great culture.”  
One concrete, time-bound, slightly uncomfortable goal.  
Examples:  
“Reach €15M ARR with 20% EBITDA by Dec 2027.”  
“Have a self-managing leadership team by Q4 2026 (company runs 3 months without me).”  
“Become the \#1 recommended employer in our niche by 2028.”  
The question is: What would be unquestionably worth reorganizing your life around for the next 3–5 years?  
Write that in the center.  
Step 2: Choose your 8 pillars  
These are the major domains that must upgrade for that central goal to be real.  
Don’t copy Ohtani’s pillars. Steal the spirit.  
You might land on something like:  
Inner Game – self-regulation, clarity, emotional range.  
Team & Leadership Bench – who you are growing around you.  
Product & Customer Insight – how close you are to reality.  
Strategy & Focus – what you are not doing.  
Systems & Execution – how work actually flows.  
Capital & Risk – your relationship to money and downside.  
Culture & Karma – how it feels to work with you.  
Body & Energy – the organism carrying all of this.  
Notice: some are classic MBA categories. Some are closer to Ohtani’s “karma” and “personality.” Keep both. Ignore them and they will quietly cap your ceiling.  
Write each pillar in the ring around your central goal.  
Step 3: Break each pillar into 8 trainable behaviors  
This is where most leaders either get lazy or overcomplicate things.  
The rules for each box:  
It must be observable (“Did this happen today: yes/no?”).  
It must be within your control.  
It must be small enough that you can do it on a busy day.  
Examples:  
Inner Game  
10 minutes of morning stillness before phone.  
Name emotional state before 1:1s.  
Weekly reflection: “Where did I react, not respond?”  
One conversation per week where you say the hard thing clearly and kindly.  
Team & Leadership Bench  
One growth conversation per week with a direct report.  
Quarterly talent map review.  
Delegate one “I always do this” task every month.  
Culture & Karma  
“No sarcasm when stressed” rule for self.  
Publicly celebrate one person’s contribution every Friday.  
“Pick up trash” equivalent: fix one small annoyance a week for the team.  
Ask: “What’s one thing I can do to make your week easier?” in at least one meeting.  
Each box is boring. That’s the point. As Anders Ericsson’s work on deliberate practice shows, world-class outcomes sit on the shoulders of unromantic repetition.  
Step 4: Turn the grid into a daily check sheet  
This is the genius of the Harada Method.  
It doesn’t leave the 64 boxes as a motivational poster. It turns them into a “Routine Check Sheet” and a daily diary.  
You simply ask, each day:  
Which of these did I practice?  
Which did I avoid?  
What did I learn?  
There’s no moral drama. Only data.  
Over weeks, patterns emerge:  
You’re religious about product reviews but consistently ignore “take care of your body.”  
You’re meticulous with investor updates and conveniently skip “have one courageous conversation this week.”  
This is metacognition again: you see your avoidance strategies in black and white.  
Step 5: Protect the service dimension  
Ohtani’s grid is a quiet rebuke to the narcissistic version of “high performance.”  
He literally wrote down “Pick up trash” as part of his plan to become a generational athlete.  
Why does this matter for you?  
Because your success is not a solo act. Your board, your exec team, your early employees, your partner at home—they’re all deciding, constantly, how much invisible support they’re willing to extend.  
So build explicit “karma” boxes into your grid:  
“End one meeting a day by appreciating someone’s effort.”  
“Once a week, ask a teammate: ‘What are you worried about that no one is naming?’”  
“Leave every room—physical or digital—a bit clearer than you found it.”  
None of these will show up in your next funding round metrics.  
All of them will shape whether people quietly root for you, or merely tolerate you.  
The deeper invitation  
The Harada Method disguised as a productivity tool is actually a character development process.  
To fill in those 64 boxes honestly, you have to ask:  
Who am I becoming as I pursue this goal?  
What am I willing to train that my ego doesn’t want to acknowledge?  
Where do I still hope for “luck” instead of building conditions?  
Shohei Ohtani’s dream sheet is impressive not because he wrote a big goal in the middle. Teenagers do that all the time.  
It’s impressive because he was willing, at 15, to make his life answerable to that goal at the level of daily, sometimes unglamorous practice—from core strength and spin rate to picking up trash and showing respect to umpires.  
If you want to try this  
You don’t need a fancy template.  
Draw an 8×8 grid on paper.  
Put one outcome in the middle.  
Name 8 pillars that truly matter.  
Fill each with 8 small behaviors.  
Turn it into a simple daily check sheet.  
Then live with it for 90 days.  
Not as a perfection game, but as an experiment in clarity and integrity:  
“If this goal really matters, this is what ‘caring’ looks like, in practice.”  
The worst-case scenario: you’ll understand yourself, your company, and your patterns far more clearly.  
The best case: like a skinny high school pitcher who once wrote “\#1 draft pick (8 teams)” in a tiny square, you’ll wake up one day and realize the person you’ve become can hold the life you were brave enough to design.

The 64-Cell Method: Turn Your Biggest Goal Into Daily Practice  
Here's a question worth sitting with: What if the gap between you and your most audacious goal could be mapped in exactly 64 daily actions?  
When Shohei Ohtani was a teenager, he used a simple grid system to engineer his path from high school baseball player to first-round draft pick. The method he used transformed an impossible dream into inevitable reality through daily, measurable practices.  
Let me show you exactly how it works.  
The Method in Five Steps  
Step 1: Choose Your Center  
Place your biggest, most important goal in the center of a page. One goal only. Make it specific and measurable. Not "be successful" but "raise Series B by Q3" or "scale to 50 employees" or "launch in three new markets."  
Step 2: Identify Eight Pillars  
Around your central goal, identify eight essential categories that support it. Think of these as the load-bearing walls of your ambition. For a CEO, these might include: Leadership Capacity, Strategic Thinking, Team Development, Market Position, Financial Health, Personal Energy, Relationships, and Innovation.  
Step 3: Create Eight Actions Per Pillar  
For each pillar, list eight specific, daily actions or practices. This gives you 64 total cells. The magic here is specificity. Under "Personal Energy," don't write "exercise more." Write "20-minute morning walk" or "in bed by 10:30pm" or "Sunday planning session."  
Step 4: Build Your Daily Practice  
Transform your 64 cells into a daily checklist. Not all 64 need to happen every day, but each should have a rhythm. Some daily, some weekly, some monthly. The point is intentionality, not perfection.  
Step 5: Track and Adjust  
Keep a simple record of which practices you complete. After 30 days, review. What's working? What's not? Adjust the grid, but stick with the structure.  
Why This Works  
The power isn't in the framework itself. It's in what the framework forces you to do: decompose a massive goal into controllable daily actions.  
Most of us fail at big goals not because we lack vision but because we lack a bridge between vision and daily reality. We know we want to build a category-defining company, but what does that mean for Tuesday at 2pm?  
The 64-cell method answers that question precisely.  
The Hidden Wisdom  
Here's what made Ohtani's approach remarkable: his grid included elements most high achievers ignore. Beyond physical training and skill development, he included:  
Pick up trash  
Show respect to officials  
Be someone others want to support  
Practice gratitude  
Take care of equipment  
These weren't nice-to-haves. They were recognized as essential to his goal. He understood that success requires not just competence but character, not just skill but service.  
Building Your Grid  
Start simple. Take a sheet of paper and draw a 9x9 grid (center cell plus 8 around it, each with 8 supporting cells).  
Put your one big goal in the center.  
Then ask yourself: What are the eight essential areas I need to develop to achieve this?  
For each area, what are eight specific things I could do regularly that would move me forward?  
Don't overthink it. First drafts are meant to be revised. The key is to start, to make your ambition concrete and actionable.  
A Different Kind of Planning  
This isn't another goal-setting framework. It's a practice-design system. The difference matters.  
Goal-setting asks: What do I want to achieve?  
Practice-design asks: Who do I need to become?  
Goal-setting focuses on outcomes.  
Practice-design focuses on inputs.  
Goal-setting is about the future.  
Practice-design is about today.  
The Invitation  
Your biggest goal likely feels overwhelming precisely because it's big. The 64-cell method doesn't make it smaller; it makes it specific. It transforms "someday" into "today." It turns hope into practice.  
Take an hour this week. Draw your grid. Fill in your cells. Not perfectly, just honestly.  
Then tomorrow, start checking boxes.  
Because the path between where you are and where you want to be isn't mysterious. It's just 64 small, repeated actions, compounding over time.  
The grid is simple. The discipline is not. But then again, neither is the goal you're chasing.  
What will you put in your center cell?

## DOCUMENT 2: HOW TO MOVE FROM SPAGHETTI TO DARTBOARD – WHY HARD GOALS REQUIRE A DIFFERENT MINDSET 

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to move from Spaghetti to Dartboard – Why Hard Goals Require a Different Mindset 

"The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything."  
— Warren Buffett  
If you don’t set clear goals, you’ll fall for hidden distractions.  
Without intentionality, your workflow looks like this:  
You throw spaghetti at the wall.   
You see what sticks.  
You follow the path of least resistance. 

The result?   
Mediocrity.  
If you want to escape mediocrity you need a different mental model:  
Stop throwing darts in the dark if you want to achieve something truly difficult.  
Setting ambitious goals changes everything.  
Focus on a meaningful target—whether it's building deep relationships, buying a satellite, or running an ultramarathon. 

Choose something that will make a real impact on your life.  
Then, define the metrics for success.  
Build your dartboard.   
Turn on the light.   
Aim. 

Your new annual poster is precisely this: Your own personal dartboard. 

Use it to plot your year ahead.   
What is the theme of my year?   
How will I measure success?  
What are my big goals? 

Homework: I ask you to get ultra-precise on your goals until our next session.

## DOCUMENT 3: \+HOW TO FIND WHAT MOTIVATES YOU REALLY: THE 5 DRIVERS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to understand what motivates you: The 5 Drivers

What Motivates you?

Lead yourself and others by understanding the 5 Drivers.

Understanding what drives you and your teams is essential if you lead an organization.

If you are not able to understand your drivers, you will fail to   
→ understand what drives you  
→ recognize destructive patterns  
→ get above the line in your leadership

To help CEOs and founders understand their drivers, I use Taibi Kahler's Five Drivers to help them understand what drives their performance and leadership.

The 5 drivers:

1\. Please Others  
Focused on gaining approval, avoiding conflict, and being empathetic.

Positive Aspects:   
Excellent in team cohesion and diplomacy.

Challenges:   
Risk of losing self-identity, stress from over-accommodation, inability to deliver criticism.

How to balance this driver:   
Encourage assertiveness, set healthy boundaries, and foster an environment where diverse opinions are valued.

2\. Be strong   
Emphasizes resilience, independence, and stoicism.

Positive Aspects:   
Great in crisis management, self-directed, and inspiring confidence.

Challenges:   
Bottles things up, snaps in private, reluctant to collaborate, lack of vulnerability.

How to balance this driver:   
Cultivate emotional intelligence, encourage open communication, and show vulnerability as a strength.

3\. Hurry Up  
Always on the move, focused on efficiency and speed.

Positive Aspects:   
Energetic, Excellent in time management and rapid decision-making.

Challenges:   
Potential for burnout, finds it hard to say no, overlooks details.

How to balance this driver:   
Promote a balanced approach to urgency, prioritize tasks effectively, and emphasize the importance of quality over speed.

4\. Try Hard  
Focused on persistent effort, often in the face of challenges.

Positive Aspects:   
Resilient in adversity, innovative problem-solving, gives 100%, self-motivated.

Challenges:   
Tendency to overcomplicate, unwillingness to ask for help, difficulty prioritizing, and fear of failure.

How to balance this driver:  
Foster a growth mindset, celebrate small wins, and encourage smart work alongside hard work.

5\. Be Perfect  
Focused on high standards, attention to detail, and striving for perfection.

Positive Aspects:   
Quality-driven, reliable, and thorough.

Challenges:   
Paralysis and stress, effective but not efficient, slow and pedantic.

How to balance this driver:   
Prioritize continuous improvement, set realistic goals, and encourage a healthy balance between perfection and efficiency.

By identifying your drivers, you learn   
→ to recognize when you are driven  
→ to use your drivers constructively  
→ & to regulate yourself if what drives you is not useful

What is your main driver?

## DOCUMENT 4: EMPATHY TRAP

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How I coach 'empathic' CEOs out of burnout:  
Avoid the Empathy Trap.  
Most people think being empathic leads to great leadership.  
They are missing an important part:  
Compassion\!  
Training compassion matters:  
Leaders with an empathy preference have a 12 percent higher risk of burnout than leaders with a compassion preference.  
What's worse, only being empathic, without training in compassion, can lead to biased decision-making.  
You have the choice:  
Do you want to be an empathetic or a compassionate leader?  
Here is what separates empathic from compassionate leaders:  
EMPATHIC LEADER  
\-\> I feel with you.  
Connecting through empathy, you have a close, felt understanding of the other person's experience.  
With empathy, you feel with the person. You take on the other person's emotions and make those feelings your own.  
Being Empathic does not necessarily help the other:  
\-\> You can be prone to bias.  
If you are empathic, you can favor people who look similar to you and be less trusting of people who look different.  
\-\> You can fall into "empathic distress."  
Empathy can lead to emotional fatigue or burnout because of taking on others' feelings too deeply.  
COMPASSIONATE LEADER  
\-\> I am here to help.  
You have a good understanding of what the other person is experiencing. But you are also willing to act.  
You connect your emotional awareness with rational understanding (wisdom).  
You care for someone but don't necessarily feel the emotions they are feeling. This level of detachment allows you to take constructive action.  
The Formula:  
Empathy \+ Action \= Compassion  
Compassionate Leaders are needed when it gets tricky.  
Why?  
Leaders oriented toward compassion rather than empathy experience have:  
a 30 percent greater level of well-being and happiness in their life  
a 14 percent greater confidence in their leadership ability—because they feel capable of making a difference.  
Leaders who rank high on 'wise compassion' are more fulfilled than their less compassionate counterparts.  
They show:  
\-\> 66 percent lower stress  
\-\> 200 percent lower intention to quit  
\-\> 14 percent higher efficacy in their work  
Connect with empathy, but lead with compassion.  
The Short:  
Empathy is the starting point—you are feeling with someone, understanding, and sharing their emotional experience.  
Compassion is the journey from feeling to acting—it's about feeling for someone while wanting to alleviate their distress.  
What examples of compassionate leadership inspired you?

## DOCUMENT 5: HOW TO WORK FROM YOUR ZONE OF GENIUS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to work from your Zone of Genius?  
Most people spend their work life doing things they hate.  
Why?  
They work (at best\!) in their ‘Zone of Excellence.’  
They spend their days doing things they are good at but don’t enjoy doing.  
Here is how I help the executives I work with find their genius zone:  
Here is a framework that will help understand where you spend your time. 

During each day you will spend your time in one of these 4 zones:   
Zone of Incompetence  
Things other people could probably do better than you.  
Zone of Competence  
Things you do just fine, but others are equally as good at.  
Zone of Excellence  
Things you are excellent at but don't love doing.  
Zone of Genius  
Things you are uniquely good at in the world and love so much that time and space disappear.  
People who spend more time working in their unique Zone of Genius feel great, do their ‘best work,’ and tend to be kinder to themselves and others.  
Now… how to get there?  
Follow this process to get closer to working from your zone of genius:  
A) Audit your calendar  
Draw up a four-square (like the one below) separating all the tasks of your current day into these categories.  
This gives you greater clarity and perspective.  
B) Delegate  
You spend too much time doing things you are good at but hate doing.  
Because you are good at it \- everyone pushes you to take over those tasks.  
Don’t do it. Delegate those tasks.  
Being good at something does not mean you need to do it.  
This will often be the biggest block (for high-achievers) to having more time for their unique ‘Genius.’  
C) Make space  
When do you notice that you enter a zone of flow?  
What are tasks that make you forget the world around you?  
Ask your friends what they think your zone of genius is.  
Narrow it down.  
Now, make space for it:  
Daily, weekly, monthly.  
Set the time aside now in your calendar.  
This will now be a feature of each week.  
D) Take bold steps to reshuffle your life  
Experiment:  
How would your life look like if you spent 60% in your zone of genius?  
What if you dedicated three months to work on what you love doing?  
How can you better invest in and amplify that ‘Genius’ that you have?

## DOCUMENT 6: HOW TO EMBRACE THE SPIRITUAL PURSUIT OF MASTERY: THE PRINCIPLE OF KODAWARI

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How the secret behind Japanese quality can help you ship the best work of your life:  
I recently spent three weeks traveling to meet with some of the best artisans in Japan.  
I spoke with Michelin star cooks, the best Jeans-maker in the country. I spoke with successful startup founders, university professors, and innovation specialists.  
All of them mentioned this philosophical concept:  
⚡️KODAWARI  
What is it?   
Kodawari is the spiritual pursuit of mastery in your craft.  
To live your Kodawari, you pursue a   
→ deep commitment to quality,   
→ attention to detail and a   
→ continuous striving for excellence.  
Kodawari goes beyond skill and technique:  
 Living "Kodawari" makes you emotionally and spiritually dedicated to the process.  
→ You take pride in what you do, no matter how minor or routine the task may be. You apply yourself entirely to achieve the highest standards.  
Adopting the principles of Kodawari can transform the way you approach your work.  
Kodawari encourages you to   
→ focus on quality over quantity,   
→ to value the process as much as the outcome,   
→ and to continuously improve and refine your skills.  
How can you integrate Kodawari into your daily routines?  
Kodawari starts with a mindset shift:  
1\. COMMIT TO EXCELLENCE  
If it's a small task or a significant project, approach your work with the intent to do it to the best of your ability. A path to excellence will open up.  
2\. FALL IN LOVE WITH THE DETAILS  
The small things matter. Find excellence in the details that others might overlook. Learn to love the details.  
3\. NEVER STOP LEARNING   
Mastery is a journey, not a destination. Find the room for improvement. Look for new skills to acquire that give you a new perspective.  
This concept at the heart of Japanese artisans can help you find meaning and pride in your work.  
By embracing Kodawari, you will not only enhance the quality of your work but also find more profound satisfaction and meaning in what you do.  
How do you practice Kodawari in your life and work?

## DOCUMENT 7: HOW TO AVOID BURNOUT: SPOTTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMPATHY AND COMPASSION

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How I coach 'empathic' CEOs out of burnout:  
Avoid the Empathy Trap.  
Most people think being empathic leads to great leadership.  
They are missing an important part:  
Compassion\!  
Training compassion matters:  
Leaders with an empathy preference have a 12 percent higher risk of burnout than leaders with a compassion preference.  
What's worse, only being empathic, without training in compassion, can lead to biased decision-making.  
You have the choice:  
Do you want to be an empathetic or a compassionate leader?  
Here is what separates empathic from compassionate leaders:  
EMPATHIC LEADER  
\-\> I feel with you.  
Connecting through empathy, you have a close, felt understanding of the other person's experience.  
With empathy, you feel with the person. You take on the other person's emotions and make those feelings your own.  
Being Empathic does not necessarily help the other:  
\-\> You can be prone to bias.  
If you are empathic, you can favor people who look similar to you and be less trusting of people who look different.  
\-\> You can fall into "empathic distress."  
Empathy can lead to emotional fatigue or burnout because of taking on others' feelings too deeply.  
COMPASSIONATE LEADER  
\-\> I am here to help.  
You have a good understanding of what the other person is experiencing. But you are also willing to act.  
You connect your emotional awareness with rational understanding (wisdom).  
You care for someone but don't necessarily feel the emotions they are feeling. This level of detachment allows you to take constructive action.  
The Formula:  
Empathy \+ Action \= Compassion  
Compassionate Leaders are needed when it gets tricky.  
Why?  
Leaders oriented toward compassion rather than empathy experience have:  
a 30 percent greater level of well-being and happiness in their life  
a 14 percent greater confidence in their leadership ability—because they feel capable of making a difference.  
Leaders who rank high on 'wise compassion' are more fulfilled than their less compassionate counterparts.  
They show:  
\-\> 66 percent lower stress  
\-\> 200 percent lower intention to quit  
\-\> 14 percent higher efficacy in their work  
Connect with empathy, but lead with compassion.  
The Short:  
Empathy is the starting point—you are feeling with someone, understanding, and sharing their emotional experience.  
Compassion is the journey from feeling to acting—it's about feeling for someone while wanting to alleviate their distress.  
What examples of compassionate leadership inspired you?

## DOCUMENT 9: HOW TO GET LESS DISTRACTED: 4 STEPS TO RECLAIM FOCUS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to Stop Getting Distracted  
4 Simple Steps to Reclaim Your Focus  
13 Weeks of Your Year Are Lost Due to Distractions  
Here is how you can reclaim your focus.  
Step 1: Accept Distraction as Your Default  
Start to accept that distraction is your default. Let go of “I should” or “I need.”  
Step 2: Train Your Awareness  
Train your awareness by pointing it towards a subject (breath, body, mantra). When your mind wanders, bring it back. Think of this like “lifting weights” – the more you train, the better you get.  
Step 3: Maintain a Healthy Body and Mind  
A healthy body leads to a healthy mind. A healthy mind leads to a healthy body. Train your body to be fit and in shape. Reduce unnecessary stressors. Seek virtuous loops: slowly but surely, you will have more energy and awareness.  
Step 4: Pay Attention to Your Mind’s Patterns  
Pay attention to where your mind goes when it “distracts.” Every recurring thought shows you your patterns or hidden values. Those patterns gift you a deeper understanding of yourself. Cherish them.  
Step 5: Open Awareness Meditation  
Start to pay attention to where your mind goes when you let it free. This is called “open awareness meditation.” Try enjoying being distracted: you are training your mind while curiously exploring how it makes sense of the world around you.

## DOCUMENT 10: THE 5 MENTAL BIASES THAT SABOTAGE YOUR LEADERSHIP

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The 5 mental biases that sabotage your leadership:  
As humans, we don't see the world clearly.  
We are born by default with:  
Distorted perception  
Faulty decision making  
Overconfidence  
Inaccurate predictions  
Our brains created "shortcuts," aka biases, to save time.  
If you don't recognize those biases, they will get the best of your leadership. To cultivate clear thinking, recognise the most important 5 biases that sabotage your leadership.  
1\. Confirmation bias  
You favour information that confirms your existing beliefs, ignoring or dismissing contradictory evidence.  
Example: You might dismiss critical feedback about your strategy because it conflicts with your original vision.  
2\. Availability heuristic  
You rely on information that's readily available in your memory, rather than seeking out more accurate or complete information.  
Example: You may base decisions on recent events or vivid examples rather than comprehensive data. Even worse, you dont seek out the knowledge needed to take good decisions.  
3\. Anchoring bias  
You rely heavily on the first piece of information you receive when making decisions, even if it's irrelevant or inaccurate.  
Example: Evaluating an employee based mainly on your first impression or earliest interactions, rather than their recent, comprehensive performance record.  
4\. Hindsight bias  
After an event has occurred, you tend to believe you predicted it accurately, underestimating the uncertainty you faced before the event.  
Example: Believing you always knew a project would fail prevents you from learning from mistakes.  
5\. Self-serving bias  
You attribute your successes to internal factors and blame failures on external factors, preserving your self-esteem.  
Example: Blaming poor quarterly results solely on external market conditions can prevent necessary improvements and accountability.  
Being aware of these biases can help mitigate their effects in decision-making and interactions.  
Summary  
Recognise these biases to cultivate clear thinking:  
Confirmation: you favour what you already believe  
Availability: you rely on what you know, even if incomplete  
Anchoring: the first information wins, even if wrong  
Hindsight: you falsely think you predicted an outcome  
Self-serving: you blame failures on others  
Which biases are you aware of that sabotage your clear thinking?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to multiply the impact of your leadership:   
The 5 Creative Tendencies of High Impact leaders

The best leaders in the world know and avoid their reactive behaviors.

They have cultivated creative behaviors that multiply their leadership instead.

A recent study of the CEOs of the world’s most successful organizations shows that 5 creative “learned behaviors” exponentially increase your leadership effectiveness.

Here are the 5 Creative Behaviors That Multiply Your Leadership Effectiveness:

	1\.	Relating

Your capability to relate to others in a way that brings out the best in people, groups, and organizations.  
Competencies:  
	•	Caring Connection  
	•	Collaboration  
	•	Fostering Team Play  
	•	Mentoring & Developing  
	•	Interpersonal Intelligence

	2\.	Self-Awareness

The degree to which inner self-awareness is expressed through high-integrity leadership.

Competencies:  
	•	Selfless Leader  
	•	Composure  
	•	Personal Learner  
	•	Balance

	3\.	Authenticity

Your capability to relate to others with authenticity, courage, and high integrity.  
Competencies:  
	•	Integrity  
	•	Courageous Authenticity

	4\.	Systems Awareness  
Your awareness of whole system improvement, productivity, and community welfare.  
Competencies:  
	•	Community Concern  
	•	Systems Thinker  
	•	Sustainable Productivity

	5\.	Achieving  
Your ability to offer visionary, authentic, and high-achievement leadership.  
	•	Competencies:  
	•	Strategic Focus  
	•	Achieves Results  
	•	Decisiveness  
	•	Purposeful & Visionary

Reactive behaviors are protective patterns we resort to when we want to protect ourselves.

Creative behaviors are learned patterns we apply when we strive for something bigger than ourselves. 

They increase leadership effectiveness up to 10x.

Creative Leaders outperform reactive leaders in these tasks:  
	•	The ability to build a team  
	•	Leading by example  
	•	Being a good listener  
	•	Developing people

If you could only focus on developing one creative behavior for a year, which one would it be?

## DOCUMENT 13: HOW TO ESTABLISH EMOTIONAL FLUIDITY: RELEASING THE CONTRACTS YOU NEVER SIGNED

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Emotional Fluidity: The Contracts You Never Signed  
Somewhere along the way, you made agreements you don't remember making. Not legal contracts. Not explicit commitments. Something quieter and more binding: implicit agreements with life itself about what you must do to be safe, to be loved, to be worthy.  
These contracts run in the background like invisible code. They shape your perception. They drive your behavior. They determine what feels possible and what feels forbidden. And most of the time, you don't even know they're there.  
A friend and teacher of mine, Daniel Thorson puts it directly:   
"You have a duty to liberate your nervous system from contracts that aren't in greatest service."  
A duty. Not a nice-to-have. Not a someday project. A responsibility to yourself, to the people you lead, to the life you are here to live.  
How Contracts Form  
Every contract begins as an adaptive response. A survival strategy. A young nervous system encounters a situation it cannot fully process, and it makes a deal. If I just try harder, I will be safe. If I never rest, I will stay ahead of the danger. If I achieve enough, I will finally be worthy of love.  
These deals make sense at the moment. They help us survive. They get us through childhood, through difficult relationships, through environments that asked too much of us too soon.  
The problem is that contracts don't expire. They persist long after the original situation has passed. What was once adaptive becomes a prison. The strategy that protected us at five now limits us at forty-five.  
Over time, contracts distort perception. They filter reality so that we see evidence for their necessity everywhere. The contract "I'm not good enough yet" will find proof of its truth in every interaction, every outcome, every quiet moment of self-reflection. It sustains itself by shaping what we notice.  
This is how suffering perpetuates. Not because life is inherently painful, but because we are caught in agreements that keep generating the same experience, again and again.  
The Core Contracts  
In my work with founders and CEOs, I encounter certain contracts repeatedly. They show up across industries, across personalities, across levels of success. If anything, success often strengthens them, because it seems to validate the strategy.  
I need to try harder. No matter how much effort you give, it is never quite enough. Rest feels dangerous. Ease feels like failure. The contract insists that more effort is always the answer, even when exhaustion is the problem.  
I'm not good enough yet. There is always another milestone, another achievement, another version of yourself that will finally be acceptable. The goalposts move perpetually. Arrival is impossible because the contract requires you to keep striving.  
I need to prepare to be safe. Hypervigilance masquerading as responsibility. The belief that if you just anticipate enough, plan enough, worry enough, you can prevent bad things from happening. The nervous system stays on alert, scanning for threats that may never come.  
I can't rest. Rest feels like vulnerability. Stillness feels like falling behind. The contract equates productivity with worth, and so stopping becomes existentially threatening, even when your body is begging for it.  
Only if I achieve X will I be worthy of love. Perhaps the deepest contract of all. The belief that love is conditional, that it must be earned, that who you are is not enough without what you accomplish. This one runs entire careers. Sometimes entire lives.  
Emotional Fluidity: The Alternative  
Joe Hudson speaks of emotional fluidity: the capacity to feel what is here without resistance. This is the opposite of contraction. It is allowing experience to move through you rather than getting stuck.  
When we operate from contracts, we resist certain emotions. The contract "I can't rest" makes us resist the feeling of tiredness. The contract "I'm not good enough" makes us resist the feeling of satisfaction. We clamp down on what the contract says we should not feel, and in doing so, we freeze our inner world.  
Fluidity is different. It does not mean you like every emotion. It means you stop fighting what is already present. You let anger be anger. You let grief be grief. You let exhaustion be exhaustion. And in that allowing, something shifts. What is permitted to be felt can move. What is resisted stays stuck.  
This is not passive. It takes courage to feel what you have been avoiding, sometimes for decades. But it is the doorway out of the contract.  
Burning the Contract  
Contracts can be dissolved. Not through willpower or positive thinking, but through a different kind of work: acknowledging what is there, externalizing it, and releasing it.  
The first step is recognition. You cannot burn a contract you don't know you have. This requires honest self-inquiry. Where do I feel trapped? What beliefs drive my compulsive behaviors? What would I do differently if I weren't afraid?  
The second step is acknowledgment. Not judgment, not shame, but genuine recognition of the contract's origin. This agreement made sense once. It helped me survive. It deserves respect, even as I choose to release it.  
The third step is externalization. Seeing the contract as something you have rather than something you are. You are not "someone who can't rest." You are someone who made an agreement, long ago, that rest was dangerous. The agreement is not your identity. It is a pattern you can change.  
The fourth step is release. This can happen through imaginal practice, through somatic work, through conversation with a skilled guide. The contract is "burned" not by force but by presence: by bringing full awareness to it until it loses its grip.  
What Becomes Possible  
When contracts dissolve, perception shifts. You begin to see reality more clearly, less filtered by old survival strategies. You discover that rest does not lead to catastrophe. That love does not require achievement. That you are, in fact, good enough already.  
This is not the end of ambition. It is the beginning of a different kind of motivation: one rooted in genuine desire rather than compensatory striving. You can still work hard, build things, pursue excellence. But the desperate quality falls away. The compulsion softens into choice.  
Your nervous system relaxes. Your relationships deepen. Your leadership becomes less reactive, more grounded, more free.  
The contracts you never signed can be released. It is not easy work. But it may be the most important work you ever do.  
You have a duty to liberate yourself. What would you do, who would you be, if you were no longer bound by agreements that no longer serve?  
Releasing the Agreements You Never Knew You Made  
There is a particular kind of exhaustion that has nothing to do with how much sleep you got. It comes from carrying obligations you never consciously chose. From trying to fulfill contracts you signed before you had words for what you were agreeing to.  
These are the invisible vows running your nervous system: Try harder. Figure it out alone. Don't take too much space. Be the strong one. You must do it because no one else can.  
You did not sign these agreements in ink. You signed them in survival. And now, decades later, they are still binding.  
What Agreements Actually Are  
Agreements (sometimes called contracts) are the implicit rules your younger self adopted to navigate circumstances that felt overwhelming. They were adaptive. They were intelligent. A child's nervous system, facing more than it could process, made a deal: If I just do this, I will be safe. If I never do that, I will be loved.  
The problem is that these agreements do not update themselves. The situation changes. You grow. You build companies, lead teams, raise families. But the old code keeps running. The five-year-old's survival strategy is still directing the forty-five-year-old's behavior.  
This is why you cannot simply think your way out. The agreements live in the body, in the nervous system, beneath conscious awareness. They need to be met where they live.  
Why This Practice Works  
Three things happen when we work with agreements directly.  
First, safety. Grounding the body and establishing a felt boundary tells the nervous system: we are safe enough now. This is not a small thing. When the system feels safe, more mature capacities come online. Attention broadens. Empathy becomes possible. Choice returns.  
Second, naming. Precisely acknowledging what is present (there is fear; you are overwhelmed) steadies reactivity. The emotion does not disappear, but it stops running the show. Space opens between stimulus and response.  
Third, updating. By externalizing and releasing an old contract, the system can stop rehearsing a rule that no longer serves. You are not suppressing the emotion. You are liberating it to move, to inform you, and then to complete.  
The net effect: more breath, more range, more sovereignty.  
When to Use This Practice  
This work is particularly useful when you notice:  
Repeating, stuck emotions that keep cycling through (fear, overwhelm, resentment, apathy).  
Patterns of over-responsibility or martyrdom, where you carry what is not yours to carry.  
Transitions and thresholds: after losses, launches, retreats, or any moment when old rules surface with fresh intensity.  
Before making new commitments, when you want to choose consciously rather than from inherited obligation.  
One important note: if you are highly activated (panic, dissociation, flooding), down-regulate first. Long exhale. Orienting to the room. Cold water on the face. A walk. This practice requires enough felt safety to work. It cannot be forced through activation.  
The Protocol: Releasing the Agreements  
This is an imaginal, embodied practice. It uses visualization, but it is not merely visualization. The body is involved. Emotion is involved. Precise anger is involved.  
Create the container (two minutes).  
Ground. Sit or stand. Feel weight, gravity, the floor beneath you. Let the body know: I am here.  
Establish your boundary. Sense an arm's-length perimeter around you. Let clean anger quietly power it. Not rage. Not aggression. The kind of anger that says: I protect what matters here.  
Invite. Turn toward the body. Ask: What is here right now?  
The ten steps.  
One. Spot the signal. Identify the emotion or state. Fear in the chest. A voice saying "help." A familiar heaviness. Say inwardly: I see you. You are not wrong.  
Two. Name the need. Ask that younger part: What feels too much? What are you being asked to do that is beyond you?  
Three. Roll out the parchment. Within your boundary, imagine placing a blank sheet. This is where the agreements will become visible.  
Four. Project the agreements. Let the system "print" the rules onto the parchment. Words, images, memories. Whatever appears. Common examples:  
Try very hard.  
Figure it out by yourself.  
You are only loved if you are able.  
Do not take too much space; others first.  
Be the role model.  
You must do it; no one else can.  
Five. Acknowledge the cost. Notice what arises. Tiredness. Grief. Anger. Let it be there. Breathe.  
Six. Fold and eject. Fold the parchment. With precise anger (not violence, but clarity), throw it outside your boundary.  
Seven. Destroy. Let it burn, dissolve, explode in water. Watch it fully disintegrate outside your perimeter.  
Eight. Re-attune. Feel ground and boundary again. Sense the system now. Let any sadness move. Let the body settle.  
Nine. Optional re-burn. If a skeptical voice appears ("Too late; this is already part of me"), put that on parchment too. Burn the meta-contract.  
Ten. Conscious re-contracting. Only when ready, choose one simple adult agreement that serves reality, goodness, and your care. Examples:  
I share responsibility with others; I am not the only adult in the room.  
I am loved for being, not for output.  
I ask for help early.  
Speak the new agreement aloud. Feel if the younger part relaxes. If not, simplify and slow down.  
Common Legacy Agreements  
In my work with leaders, certain contracts appear again and again:  
Try very hard; effort proves worth. No amount of work is ever enough. Rest feels like failure.  
Solve it alone; needing help is weakness. Asking for support feels shameful. You carry everything yourself.  
Do not take space; keep others comfortable. Your needs come last. You shrink to make room for everyone else.  
Be the strong one; model perfection. Vulnerability is not allowed. You must never let them see you struggle.  
You must carry it; others cannot. You are the only one who can do this. Delegating feels like abandonment.  
Only output earns love. Who you are is not enough. What you produce is what makes you worthy.  
Each of these can be rewritten into an adult, reality-based, pro-relationship agreement. But first, the old one must be seen, acknowledged, and released.  
Aftercare and Integration  
This work takes energy. Old binds, even when released, leave residue. Treat yourself accordingly.  
Rest and replenish. Tiredness is common. Drink water. Walk. Nap if you can.  
Micro-check three times daily. Ground? Boundary? What agreement is running me right now?  
Journal one line: Old contract I noticed … New agreement I choose …  
Rehearse. Imagine three near-term situations where the new agreement applies. See and feel yourself enacting it. This is not wishful thinking. It is training the nervous system for a different response.  
What Becomes Possible  
When you release agreements that no longer serve, you do not become careless or uncommitted. You become more capable of genuine commitment. You can choose what you give yourself to, rather than being driven by invisible obligations.  
Your nervous system settles. Your relationships shift. Your leadership becomes less about proving and more about serving.  
The contracts you made as a child were intelligent responses to impossible situations. Honor them for what they were. And then, with clarity and compassion, let them go.  
You are allowed to re-contract with life from who you are now. From adult clarity. From conscious choice. From sovereignty.  
What would you commit to if you were truly free to choose?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Changing the Way You Listen Can Change Your Life  
Introducing the 4 Ways of Listening—a concept developed by MIT management thinker Otto Scharmer.  
1\. Habitual Listening  
Listening on Autopilot  
	•	You reconfirm what you already know.  
	•	You reactively respond if something doesn’t fit within your existing paradigm.  
2\. Factual Listening  
Listening for the Facts  
	•	You listen to assess if what you hear makes sense or doesn’t.  
	•	You suspend habitual judgment to understand the situation objectively.  
3\. Empathic Listening  
Listening for Complementary Perspectives  
	•	You put yourself in the speaker’s shoes, using empathic intelligence.  
	•	By embracing ambiguity, you open yourself to opposing truths and gain a broader perspective.  
4\. Generative Listening  
Listening for Potential  
	•	You become aware of the creative opportunities in the moment.  
	•	By deeply tuning into the highest possible future, you invite the future in and harvest the potential of a situation.  
Reflection  
“Leveling up your listening can make or unmake your life.”  
Consider: What level of listening is your default?

## DOCUMENT 18: HOW TO CREATE PLACES OF BELONGING \- 3 MOVES TO TRANSCEND THE WHEEL OF PRIVILEGE 

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to create places of belonging: 3 moves to transcend the Wheel of Privilege   
“Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance, and belonging is having the opportunity to choose a song from the playlist."  
Ajaz Ahmed  
Great power comes with great responsibility:  
Power goes beyond fancy job titles.  
Power is brutal.   
Power shapes how able you are to choose your own and others  
→ actions  
→ behaviors  
→ & opinions.  
\#theforceiswithyou  
Power \= your ability to control outcomes.  
There is an easy way to check how much POWER you have.   
Check yourself on the wheel of privilege:   
Are you  
a) Heterosexual  
Yes ( ) No ( )  
b) White  
Yes ( ) No ( )  
c) With Citizenship  
Yes ( ) No ( )  
d) Able-bodied (no-health and body issues)  
Yes ( ) No ( )  
e) University-educated  
Yes ( ) No ( )  
f) Executive  
Yes ( ) No ( )  
If you said yes more than 3 times, you hold significantly more power than others.  
What does that mean?  
→ You have more ability to shape this world than others.  
But what does that mean in real life?  
It means that you have held significantly more privileges than others.   
Most of which you are probably not even aware of.   
\#youarethedisneyprincess  
What is the effect if your power is unchecked?  
It starts embarrassing. It ends tragically.  
The route to unchecked power goes like this. You  
say things where minorities cringe  
create spaces where some don't feel at home  
only see your world and impose actions that hurt others   
But you can choose how to wield your power.   
Evil Sith Lord or a young Skywalker?  
Just know that you have to make that choice.   
If you want to rise to your responsibility, you must put in the work.  
These 3 moves will help you create spaces of belonging:  
A. Seek what you don't know:  
Actively seek the viewpoints of people not fortunate enough to be at the center of the wheel of privilege. Training, conversations, and experiences help you to widen the range of what you see.   
→ Awareness does not come to you; you have to seek it.   
B. Hand the playlist to others:  
"Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance, and belonging is having the opportunity to choose a song from the playlist." Create spaces where non-privileged individuals can set the playlist to dance to.   
→ Become a lover of different styles of music  
C. Play Aikido with your Insecurities:  
Notice your defenses coming up. Once we share or give away "power," it feels threatening. You won't hold the reign at all costs anymore, which makes you vulnerable. Instead of closing down, notice that vulnerability. Play Aikido with it.   
→ Sharing your vulnerability will make the space safer for all.  
Places of belonging are essential to creating work that is bigger than yourself.   
I will spare you the data on why diverse teams beat teams stuck in their bubble.   
Because that is not what it is about.  
In the end:  
 If your workplace is a place of belonging, you and everyone around you will feel more human showing up.   
And that quality of being plays in an entirely different league.   
Reflect:  
→ How can you handle this responsibility best to benefit all?

## DOCUMENT 19: HOW TO HAVE CREATIVE CONFIDENCE LIKE A HARVARD GRADUATE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The true benefit of elite schools, such as the Ivy Leagues and other top-tier institutions, often goes far beyond the formal education or the prestige that accompanies their names. While it’s easy to get caught up in debates about whether these schools are necessary or even beneficial in the grand scheme, there’s an often overlooked but crucial advantage they provide: the cultivation of what might be termed creative and analytical confidence.  
The Cultivation of Creative and Analytical Confidence  
Through my work with many founders and CEOs who have emerged from these institutions, one consistent trait stands out—these individuals have an unshakeable confidence in their ability to tackle complex challenges. This isn’t merely about arrogance or bravado; it’s a deeply ingrained belief in their capacity to analyze, understand, and creatively address problems that others might shy away from. This confidence is a byproduct of several key experiences that elite schools uniquely offer.

Exposure to Great Minds and First Principles  
At elite schools, students are routinely exposed to some of the most brilliant minds of our time—professors, guest lecturers, and even peers who have already made significant contributions to their fields. This exposure does more than impart knowledge; it models a way of thinking. When students see how these intellectuals approach problems—often through the lens of first principles, breaking down complex issues into their fundamental elements—they learn to trust in their own analytical processes. They start to see challenges not as insurmountable obstacles but as puzzles to be dissected and solved.

The Space to Experiment, Fail, and Adjust  
One of the most valuable yet intangible benefits of elite schools is the freedom they afford students to experiment, fail, and then recalibrate. In these environments, failure is not stigmatized but seen as a critical part of the learning process. This culture of experimentation fosters resilience and adaptability. When students are encouraged to try, fail, and then try again, they build a form of confidence that is both creative and analytical. They understand that the path to innovation is not linear but iterative, requiring persistence and flexibility.

A Network of Like-Minded Individuals  
Another often understated benefit of elite schools is the network of peers—equally driven, intelligent, and ambitious individuals who challenge each other and share in the journey of intellectual exploration. This collective environment of high achievers creates a reinforcing loop: confidence begets more confidence. Students are pushed not just by the curriculum but by the expectations and accomplishments of those around them. This network extends beyond graduation, continuing to offer support, inspiration, and collaboration throughout their careers.

The Sense of Authorship  
Ultimately, what elite schools impart is a sense of authorship over one’s own path. The combination of rigorous intellectual training, exposure to pioneering thinkers, and a culture that embraces both success and failure helps students develop the conviction that they can—and should—carve their own way forward. This sense of authorship is foundational for leaders who are expected not just to manage but to create, innovate, and lead others through uncharted territories.

The Need for More Spaces to Foster This Confidence  
Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that this creative and analytical confidence can and does develop outside the confines of elite universities. However, these schools have traditionally been the crucible where such traits are most intensively forged. The challenge for society is to recognize the importance of this meta-skill and to create more environments that nurture it. Whether through alternative educational models, professional environments, or community initiatives, fostering this kind of confidence should be a priority if we want to build better organizations, solve society’s most pressing problems, and inspire the next generation of leaders.

Conclusion: Nurturing Confidence Beyond Elite Institutions  
In conclusion, while an elite education is not the only path to success, the unique environment it provides has undeniable benefits, particularly in fostering the creative and analytical confidence necessary for leadership and innovation. The task before us is to democratize access to these kinds of experiences and cultivate similar traits in diverse settings, ensuring that more people have the opportunity to develop the confidence to think critically, act boldly, and lead effectively in their respective fields.

## DOCUMENT 21: HOW TO WIDEN YOUR BANDWIDTH: THE TRAINING OF APPROPRIATENESS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Mastering Leadership Bandwidth: Balancing Opposites Through Intelligent Discernment  
Zen Master Yunmen was once asked by a student, "What is the highest, most profound teaching of all the buddhas?" Yunmen responded succinctly: "An appropriate statement."  
This deceptively simple exchange encapsulates a profound truth about leadership: the greatest skill is responding precisely and appropriately to each unique moment.

The Zen of Leadership Bandwith   
As leaders, we are continually challenged by situations that require navigating between seemingly opposing forces. Broadening our bandwidth—our capacity for nuanced, intelligent discernment—is essential for transcending habitual reactions and making impactful, wise decisions.  
In Buddhism, this intelligent discernment is called Prajna. Often misinterpreted simply as wisdom, Prajna more accurately translates to clear, responsive awareness—a cultivated ability to see beyond binary choices and react adeptly to complex circumstances.  
Consider these essential leadership dualities:

1\. Being "Perfect" vs. Being "Good Enough"  
The skilled leader discerns when a situation demands meticulous, expert-level execution versus when applying the Pareto principle (achieving 80% impact with 20% effort) is more appropriate. Sometimes perfectionism serves; other times it creates diminishing returns and unnecessary delays.  
2\. Now vs. Tomorrow  
Leadership requires navigating the tension between immediate, actionable focus and strategic foresight. While some situations demand urgent attention to present concerns, others require looking beyond the horizon to prepare for future challenges and opportunities.  
3\. Relaxation vs. Pressure  
The composed, calm approach serves many leadership situations, creating space for thoughtful decisions. Yet there are moments when appropriate anxiety or heightened alertness becomes necessary, particularly when facing uncertainty or potential risks.  
4\. Strictly Business vs. Bonding  
Effective leadership involves knowing when to maintain professional boundaries and when to invest in relationship-building. Technical expertise and task orientation must be balanced with the human connection that builds trust and loyalty.  
5\. Accepting vs. Negotiating  
Discernment is required to recognize when accepting the status quo conserves valuable energy versus when pushing for beneficial change is worth the investment. Wisdom lies in knowing which battles to fight.  
6\. Lead Yourself vs. Facilitate Others  
Self-leadership and personal accountability establish credibility, while the ability to enable and support others' growth creates multiplication of impact. Both are essential dimensions of leadership bandwidth.  
7\. Persuasiveness vs. Assertiveness  
Some situations call for the soft influence of persuasion, while others demand clear, assertive direction. The leader with bandwidth can employ both approaches and recognize which will be most effective.  
8\. Harmony vs. Conflict  
While promoting unity and alignment serves many situations, there are times when engaging constructively in disagreements becomes necessary for innovation and growth. Avoiding all conflict can be as limiting as creating unnecessary tension.  
9\. Overthinking vs. Making a Decision  
Deep analytical thinking serves complex problems, but decision paralysis undermines leadership. Knowing when sufficient information exists to act decisively is a crucial leadership skill.  
10\. Reward vs. Feedback  
Recognizing achievement builds motivation and engagement, while honest developmental feedback drives growth and improvement. Both are necessary tools in the leader's toolkit.  
11\. Open-minded vs. Fixing  
An exploratory, curious approach keeps learning alive, while problem-solving intervention addresses immediate needs. Effective leaders know when to explore and when to execute.  
12\. Listening vs. Assertiveness  
Active, receptive listening creates understanding and psychological safety, while confident assertion provides clarity and direction. Moving fluidly between these modes expands leadership impact.Common Pitfalls of Inexperienced Executives  
“I have to be a servant leader"  
New executives often fall into the trap of viewing leadership challenges as binary, either-or decisions. 

This oversimplification leads to rigidity—favoring one extreme while neglecting the nuance required in effective leadership.   
For example, an inexperienced leader might consistently choose "assertiveness" over "listening," missing crucial team insights, or prioritize immediate outcomes at the expense of long-term strategy.  
Intelligent Discernment: The Mindful CEO Advantage  
In contrast, a mindful CEO approaches leadership with a cultivated awareness—embracing complexity, context, and subtlety.   
They recognize that true effectiveness emerges from intelligent discernment, the mindful ability to respond dynamically to each situation. Rather than defaulting to unexamined scripts, the mindful CEO continuously broadens their toolbox, cultivating Prajna.   
Through practice and reflection, they transcend simple binaries, converting complexity into clarity and fostering an organizational culture of thoughtful, responsive leadership.  
Ultimately, leadership bandwidth is not about mastering dichotomies but transcending them, transforming complexity into clarity through the practice of intelligent discernment—Prajna in action.  
Expaninding your range to avoid the default  
As Zen teaches us, responding appropriately doesn't happen by chance. It results from years of intentional mind cultivation. In leadership, this means deliberately expanding our range beyond comfortable defaults.  
Prajna—intelligent discernment—develops through practice, self-awareness, and the willingness to operate outside our comfort zones.   
The most effective leaders don't just possess technical skills or charisma; they've developed the bandwidth to respond to each situation with what it truly requires rather than what feels most natural or familiar to them.  
By embracing these opposing forces not as contradictions but as complementary aspects of leadership, we develop the expansive bandwidth that allows us to offer what Yunmen would call "an appropriate statement"—the right response, at the right time, in the right way.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to find what really drives you: The Five Drivers  
What Motivates you?  
Understanding what drives you and your teams is essential if you lead an organization.  
Especially if you are not aware of it.   
If you are not able to understand your drivers, you will fail to   
→ understand what drives you  
→ recognize destructive patterns  
→ get above the line in your leadership  
To help CEOs and founders understand their drivers, I use Taibi Kahler's Five Drivers to help them understand what drives their performance and leadership.  
The 5 Drivers:  
1\. Please Others  
Focused on gaining approval, avoiding conflict, and being empathetic.  
Positive Aspects:   
Excellent in team cohesion and diplomacy.  
Challenges:   
Risk of losing self-identity, stress from over-accommodation, inability to deliver criticism.  
How to balance this driver:   
Encourage assertiveness, set healthy boundaries, and foster an environment where diverse opinions are valued.  
2\. Be strong   
Emphasizes resilience, independence, and stoicism.  
Positive Aspects:   
Great in crisis management, self-directed, and inspiring confidence.  
Challenges:   
Bottles things up, snaps in private, reluctant to collaborate, lack of vulnerability.  
How to balance this driver:   
Cultivate emotional intelligence, encourage open communication, and show vulnerability as a strength.  
3\. Hurry Up  
Always on the move, focused on efficiency and speed.  
Positive Aspects:   
Energetic, Excellent in time management and rapid decision-making.  
Challenges:   
Potential for burnout, finds it hard to say no, overlooks details.  
How to balance this driver:   
Promote a balanced approach to urgency, prioritize tasks effectively, and emphasize the importance of quality over speed.  
4\. Try Hard  
Focused on persistent effort, often in the face of challenges.  
Positive Aspects:   
Resilient in adversity, innovative problem-solving, gives 100%, self-motivated.  
Challenges:   
Tendency to overcomplicate, unwillingness to ask for help, difficulty prioritizing, and fear of failure.  
How to balance this driver:  
Foster a growth mindset, celebrate small wins, and encourage smart work alongside hard work.  
5\. Be Perfect  
Focused on high standards, attention to detail, and striving for perfection.  
Positive Aspects:   
Quality-driven, reliable, and thorough.  
Challenges:   
Paralysis and stress, effective but not efficient, slow and pedantic.  
How to balance this driver:   
Prioritize continuous improvement, set realistic goals, and encourage a healthy balance between perfection and efficiency.  
By identifying your drivers, you learn   
→ to recognize when you are driven

How to work smarter:  
3 rules for creating the best work of your life.  
The uncomfortable truth for high achievers (based on a Stanford study):  
Productivity declines  
→ when you work longer than 50 hours per week.  
→ And it sharply declines after 55 hours.  
The truth is:  
"What you work on and how you work is more important than how hard you work."  
More important than working hard is working smart.  
Follow these 3 rules to work smarter:  
1\. SCHEDULE DEEP WORK  
4 hours of undisturbed work is more valuable than 8 hours of distracted work.  
→ Block deep work in chunks in your calendar. Avoid task-switching at all costs  
2\. FOCUS ON THE RIGHT THING  
Being trapped in busy-work keeps you from looking at the big picture.  
→ Reassess often what needs priority. Refocus on the 20% that bring in 80% of the results.  
3\. BUILD SYSTEMS THAT REWARD CONSISTENCY  
Every “overnight success” takes 7 years. Build systems that include rest and joy while incentivizing you to play the long game.  
→ Design a routine that you love to do consistently.  
In summary, here are the 3 rules for smart work:  
1\. Schedule Deep Work  
2\. Focus on the Right Thing  
3\. Build Systems that Reward Consistency

## DOCUMENT 25: HOW TO OUTSMART THE DUNNING-KRUGER EFFECT: AVOID STUPIDITY WITH MUNGER’S PRINCIPLE OF INVERSION

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to Outsmart the Dunning-Kruger Effect: Avoid Stupidity with Munger’s Principle of Inversion  
The best leaders I know are obsessed with learning. They are constantly refining their mental models.  
But unlike what most people assume, true learning isn't about vanity metrics like being "the smartest person in the room." Instead, it’s about developing the ability to recognize and avoid stupidity.  
Let us take a look at the Dunning-Kruger Effect through the lens of one of the most famous model thinkers and investors, Charlie Munger.  
What is the Dunning-Kruger Effect?  
It’s the cognitive bias we all fall into:  
Those with the least competence overestimate their abilities.  
Experts—who truly understand complexity—often doubt themselves.  
It’s why ignorance feels like confidence, and why wisdom feels like doubt.  
The Three Pitfalls of the Dunning-Kruger Effect  
Overconfidence Without Competence  
“If a man’s arrogant, you just have to sit back and let him self-destruct.” — 

The paradox of learning is that the less you know, the more confident you feel. Novices don’t know what mastery looks like, so they assume they’ve already reached it. This is why beginners often speak with the most certainty, while experts hesitate.  
The Expert’s Curse: Doubting What You Know  
“The trouble with making easy things seem difficult is that smart people will always second-guess themselves.”

When you truly understand a subject, you see its depth, nuance, and uncertainty. You recognize how much more there is to know. Ironically, this self-awareness can lead to imposter syndrome, where skilled individuals underestimate their own abilities.  
The Incompetent Can't See Their Own Blind Spots  
“If you’re not confused, you’re not thinking hard enough.”

The problem with low competence is that it blocks self-awareness. Incompetent individuals don’t just lack the skills—they lack the ability to recognize their own incompetence. This is why feedback, mentorship, and critical thinking are crucial.  
How to Outsmart the Dunning-Kruger Effect  
Knowing that you will fall for this trap you can actively work around it. There are three ways to outsmart your tendency to over and underestimate your knowledge:  
Adopt Munger’s Principle of Inversion  
Instead of asking, “How can I be smart?” ask, “How can I avoid stupidity?”  
Study past failures—yours and others’.  
Assume you’re missing something and actively look for it.  
Seek counterarguments to your beliefs.  
Use a Feedback Loop  
“You’d be amazed at how much Warren \[Buffett\] and I learn just by sitting on our asses and reading.”  
Test what you think you know.  
Surround yourself with people who challenge you.  
Get into rooms where you are the least knowledgeable person.  
Think in Probabilities, Not Absolutes  
“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do.”  
If you’re 100% sure about something, you’re probably missing something.  
Be comfortable saying, “I don’t know”—it’s a sign of intelligence.  
Let us recap, it is hard to estimate how much you know:  
Those with the least competence overestimate their abilities.  
Experts—who truly understand complexity—often doubt themselves.  
Use these 3 learnings to don't fall into traps:  
Avoid Overconfidence Without Competence – The less you know, the more confident you might feel. Always question your own certainty.  
Use Feedback Loops – Surround yourself with people who challenge your thinking and expose you to different perspectives.  
Think in Probabilities, Not Absolutes – Be comfortable with uncertainty and never assume you have all the answers.  
The next time you feel too confident, remember this:  
It’s not certainty that makes you wise—it’s the ability to question what you think you know.  
Where in your leadership have you been over and underestimated what you know?

How to Outsmart the Dunning-Kruger Effect: Think Clearly by Inverting Like Charlie Munger  
The most impactful leaders aren’t those obsessed with appearing smart—they’re relentless in their pursuit of clarity. True wisdom, as Charlie Munger repeatedly teaches, isn’t about outsmarting everyone in the room; it’s

## DOCUMENT 26: HOW TO BE MORE EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT (JOE HUDSON)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to be more emotionally intelligent (without trying so hard)  
Guest writing by Joe Hudson  
1\. If you’re scared of feeling an emotion, you’re already in it.  
2\. Constantly trying to make sense of your emotions prevents you from hearing their wisdom.  
3\. Joy is the matriarch of a family of emotions. She won’t come into your house if her children are not welcome.  
4\. If you can’t welcome the emotion, welcome the resistance to it.  
5\. Ego is as much what you don’t think you are as what you think you are.  
6\. You can’t give or receive love fully if you’re constantly calculating what could go wrong.  
7\. You also cannot love fully unless you see that you are completely empowered. It is near impossible to love what you think oppresses you.  
8\. We often abandon ourselves in an attempt to prevent other people from abandoning us.  
9\. When your thinking is binary, fear is running the show.  
10\. The next time you’re in freeze or depression, notice how much of it is repressed or held back anger.  
11\. Anger in its purity is beautiful.  
(Trying to change somebody, dominate, or control them isn’t anger—it’s manipulation.)  
12\. The next time you’re feeling anxious, notice how much of it is repressed or held back excitement.  
13\. People don’t want you to be perfect. They want to feel connected to you.  
14\. People who are exhausted all day often habitually beat themselves up or tell themselves how they “should” be.  
15\. Endless self-criticism usually signals that you want to be seen as valuable rather than actually be of value.  
16\. There is no way of getting it perfect. There is no finish line, no done. There is simply “What’s the next experiment?” There is only play.  
17\. If you can’t say “no” easily, you can’t be trusted.  
18\. If it feels scary to say, it’s important.  
• If it feels scary to say, NOT saying it will hurt your connection.  
• If it feels scary to say, NOT saying it prioritizes their imagined reaction over your truth.  
19\. You can’t be accepted for who you are if you’re not showing up as who you are.  
20\. We’re scared of the consequences of revealing our true selves. But whatever that consequence is, it’s also a direct path to acceptance and love for who we truly are.  
21\. Willpower is needed for desires from the head, not from the heart.  
22\. If you feel oppressed, the most powerful oppressor is the thought that you can’t do anything about it.  
23\. If you struggle with paying attention: What was the quality of attention you received as a kid?  
24\. Managing other people’s feelings means you’re abandoning your own.  
25\. Peace doesn’t mean never feeling agitated; it means the ability to be with agitation without aversion.  
26\. People can’t be split into parts you accept and parts you reject. People are whole.  
27\. Unconditional love isn’t caretaking. It’s holding space for others’ choices while honoring your own truth.  
28\. Judging others for showing off often reveals our own struggle to be seen.  
29\. Being known is the empty-calorie surrogate to being seen.  
30\. The desire to be special only exists when you don’t know who you truly are.  
31\. Overwhelm is fear. It occurs when you think you must leave flow to manage reality.  
32\. Seeing yourself as superior is a sign of repressed emotions—and repressing emotions means repressing joy.  
33\. Deep joy never coexists with superiority.  
34\. If you’re feeling stuck, you’re likely avoiding an emotion—fear, anger, or shame.  
35\. You cannot become more valuable.  
36\. True confidence isn’t tied to performance; it’s knowing your worth isn’t conditional.  
37\. What did you call fear around money before you knew what money was?  
38\. How does your relationship with money resemble your relationship with your parents?  
39\. Judging others’ emotions reflects a rejection of your own.  
40\. Those avoiding anger due to abusive parents often turn anger inward.  
41\. Searching for your purpose is futile, like trying to find your breath.  
42\. Your purpose is innate. Thinking you need to “find” it obstructs the trust that purpose requires to flourish.  
43\. If you say you “should” change a habit, you’ll maintain it—people rebel even against internal tyrants.  
44\. You can’t stop the voice in your head, but changing your reaction can shift its tone.  
45\. Being conflict-avoidant signals believing you can’t be loved for who you are.  
46\. If you think you must act a certain way to be loved, you’re not truly being loved—you’re performing.  
47\. Caretaking is diluted love—it lacks the vibrancy of genuine connection.  
48\. Emotional abuse includes any use of emotions to control others, not just yelling or violence.  
49\. Tension is essential—without proper tension, relationships deflate, like balloons or guitar strings losing tune.  
50\. Meditation alone is inefficient for self-discovery—it’s like building a house with only a saw. Possible, but slow.

## DOCUMENT 27: SAMURAI WISDOM: MUSASHI'S 22 RULES OF TOP PERFORMERS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The 22 Rules of top performers: timeless rules that will make you a better leader.  
My biggest inspiration for a principled life come from a samurai mastes:  
In my work, I often sit down with leaders and ask them to codify their principles.

Why?  
Principles (or heuristics) narrow down your decision-making process to simple repeatable formulas.  
Whenever in doubt, a principle helps you take decisions that are  
• ethical  
• reduce thinking time  
• and feel authentic.  
The best example of a life of principles I found comes from samurai master Miyamoto Musashi. Miyamoto. These are still the best cheatsheet for becoming a top-performer today.   
Musashi was the leading samurai warrior of his times.  
At the peak of his mastery, Musashi sat down to write the rulest he abides to and has led to his success (aka. surviving).  
He did what I ask the leaders i advise: He codified his guidelines to excellence.  
The principles he wrote down codify the experience of someone whose life depended on mastery.  
If you study them, you will see that they would still hold true to high-performers like you today.  
Musashi’s 22 principles for mastery:  
1\. Do not think dishonestly  
2\. Accept life just the way it is  
3\. Never stray from the way  
4\. Become acquainted with every art  
5\. Know the way of all professions  
6\. Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters  
7\. Develop an intuitive judgement and understanding for everything  
8\. Perceive things that cannot be seen  
9\. Pay attention even to trifles  
10\. Do not follow customary beliefs  
11\. Do nothing which is of no use  
12\. Learn in the chaos of practice  
13\. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world  
14\. In all things, have no preferences  
15\. Do not chase pleasure to escape pain  
16\. Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling  
17\. Be detached from desire  
18\. Do not regret what you have done  
19\. Never let yourself saddened by separation  
20\. Resentment and complaint are inappropriate, neither for oneself nor others  
21\. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need  
22\. Never let jealousy poison you  
Let these rules marinate.  
They will make you a better leader. And see which one you need to focus on the most at the moment.  
I hope that they give you the inspiration to write down your own.  
Do you have principles you life by?

## DOCUMENT 28: HOW TO RECOGNIZE IDIOT COMPASSION IN YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM (AND SHIFT TO WISE COMPASSION)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to Recognize Idiot Compassion in Your Leadership Team (and Shift to Wise Compassion)  
Ever wonder why your leadership team doesn't give you the full truth?  
Many inexperienced CEOs unknowingly create teams that practice "idiot compassion"—teams that validate rather than challenge their decisions. 

Here's the harsh truth: If your leadership circle consistently agrees with your viewpoint without thoughtful questioning, you're likely heading for trouble.  
Imagine repeatedly facing setbacks, only to have your team echo, "You're right, it's just bad luck," or, "The market wasn't ready."   
You feel temporarily comforted but eventually find yourself blindsided when real problems surface.  
The deeper issue?   
Surrounding yourself with "yes-people" stunts your growth as a leader. I  
diot compassion leaves you isolated from critical feedback, erodes team integrity, and ultimately sabotages your strategic decisions.   
Your team's fear of confrontation and preference for surface-level harmony keeps the truth hidden—until it's too late.  
The mindful CEO cultivates "wise compassion" instead—creating an environment where feedback is both kind and honest.   
Wise compassion, inspired by advanced meditation traditions, integrates emotional connection with objective wisdom.   
It moves from empathy ("I feel with you") toward compassion ("I'm here to help") by adding reflective insight and actionable advice.  
Here's how mindful CEOs shift their teams from idiot compassion to wise compassion:  
Foster Open Dialogue: Encourage team members to voice concerns respectfully and constructively. Make space regularly for honest conversations.  
Train Compassion, not just Empathy: Cultivate empathy within your team, but always pair it with practical action. Train your leaders to offer support that's genuinely helpful, not merely comforting.  
Welcome Constructive Discomfort: Normalize conversations that challenge assumptions. Embrace discomfort as a sign that genuine, valuable insights are surfacing.  
When you practice wise compassion, your leadership team thrives on integrity, authenticity, and genuine connection. You replace hollow validation with meaningful insight, dramatically increasing your leadership effectiveness and your organization's resilience.  
Reflect: Is your team practicing idiot compassion or wise compassion today?  
Idiot Compassion:   
“People who only validate your experiences without challenging you.”  
Wise Compassion:  
Reflective, questioning and It might involve asking, "What might be going on here?" honest conversations, preventing personal growth and insigh

“Idiot compassion is when you surround yourself with people who only validate your experiences without challenging you.   
For example, imagine someone telling her friends, "I don't understand why he broke up with me," or "I don't understand why this keeps happening to me."   
If her friends simply respond with, "No, you go girl\! He's wrong, you're right," or something similar, that's idiot compassion.   
Similarly, if someone says, "My partner is doing this," and friends immediately side with them without questioning or providing insight, that's another example of idiot compassion.  
We often mistakenly feel that our role as friends is to support our friends' positions unquestioningly. Wise compassion, on the other hand, is what you typically encounter in therapy, where the approach is more reflective and questioning.   
It might involve asking, "What might be going on here?"   
For example, if you find yourself constantly involved in conflicts everywhere you go, a therapist might gently suggest, "If a fight breaks out in every bar you visit, maybe the issue is with you." Friends practicing idiot compassion typically avoid such honest conversations, preventing personal growth and insight.  
Real growth happens when you surround yourself with people who are willing to tell you the truth kindly and respectfully, and when you're open to hearing it.   
Some might fear that friends addressing their issues directly creates unnecessary drama, but this isn't true. Healthy, communicative, open, and honest relationships thrive on this kind of wise compassion.”

## DOCUMENT 29: HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN MANTRA: THE ZÜRCHER RESSOURCE MODEL TO GET TO PEAK STATES FAST

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to create your own Mantra  
The Zürcher Ressourcen Modell (ZRM), developed by Dr. Maja Storch and Dr. Frank Krause at the University of Zurich, is a self-management method designed to help individuals understand their unconscious motives, translate them into explicit goals, and sustainably implement behavioral change.  
Here’s an intellectually stimulating, forward-thinking guide on how you can effectively use the Zürcher Ressourcen Modell:  
🧠 1\. Understand the Core Idea of ZRM  
ZRM blends insights from psychology, neurobiology, and motivational research. It’s anchored in the belief that sustainable change occurs when conscious goals align harmoniously with unconscious motives (the “somatic markers” or intuitive bodily responses). It facilitates “self-concordant” goals, where rational thinking and intuitive feeling coexist.  
Profound insight from the expert (Dr. Maja Storch):  
“Only when goals resonate emotionally, and thereby involve unconscious resources, does sustainable motivation emerge.”  
🎯 2\. The Five Phases of ZRM in Practice  
ZRM guides you systematically through five phases:  
Phase 1: Clarifying Needs and Activating Unconscious Motives  
• Select evocative images from the ZRM image library (or your curated selection).  
• Notice your spontaneous, emotional resonance—your “somatic marker” (gut feeling, warmth, openness).  
• Choose the image that resonates deeply, even if intellectually you can’t explain why.  
Phase 2: Translating Motives into Conscious Goals  
• From your chosen image, articulate a guiding motto (“Motto-Ziel”) that is emotionally compelling, positive, and action-oriented.  
• A good guiding motto is:  
• Present-focused (e.g., “I feel balanced and energized,” not “I will try to…”)  
• Affirmative, free from negations (“I move freely,” not “I don’t feel stuck”)  
• Energizing and vividly descriptive.  
Phase 3: Strengthening Motivation and Developing Resources  
• Identify existing personal resources (strengths, values, supportive social circles, past successes).  
• Use imaginative techniques, embodiment practices, and emotional anchoring to enhance motivational strength.  
• Embody your motto through gestures, postures, or symbolic reminders (e.g., a bracelet, photo, or small symbolic object).  
Phase 4: Planning Action  
• Define specific, small-scale “implementation intentions” (If-Then Plans).  
Example: “If I feel tense in a meeting, then I’ll take three mindful breaths.”  
• Anticipate potential obstacles and rehearse constructive responses mentally and physically.  
Phase 5: Integration and Maintenance  
• Continuously reflect and revise your approach based on feedback.  
• Regularly engage in brief interventions to re-anchor emotional motivation and reinforce neural patterns.  
• Maintain “resource activation” via micro-exercises and mindful awareness practices.  
🔬 3\. Leverage Neuroscience: Activating Embodied Cognition  
ZRM explicitly draws upon neurobiology, particularly the concept of “embodied cognition,” where thoughts and feelings are interconnected with bodily states. Actively include the body in your interventions (gesture training, posture shifts, symbolic objects) to wire new behavior patterns into your neural circuitry.  
Insight from expert neuroscientist Antonio Damasio:  
“Feelings are mental experiences of body states. The body is thus the theater of emotion and intuition.”  
🚀 4\. Practical Applications: Examples  
• Leadership Development:  
Align your leadership motto with embodied presence and empathetic influence. (“I lead openly, confidently, and compassionately.”)  
• Personal Growth & Self-Regulation:  
(“I greet challenges with curiosity and calm.”)  
• Organizational Transformation:  
Facilitate team workshops where participants individually and collectively articulate emotionally resonant organizational mottos.  
📌 5\. Common Mistakes to Avoid  
• Intellectualizing too soon:  
Allow intuitive responses before rational analysis.  
• Neglecting embodiment:  
ZRM explicitly values somatic experience; bypassing this reduces effectiveness.  
• Rigid goal adherence:  
Allow your motto to evolve organically.  
🌱 6\. Forward-Thinking Implications  
ZRM moves beyond mere cognitive behavioral approaches by emphasizing whole-person integration. As organizations increasingly prioritize emotional intelligence, authenticity, and mindful leadership, ZRM provides a profound, science-backed methodology for meaningful transformation.  
Future-oriented reflection (Dr. Gerald Hüther, Neurobiologist):  
“Only when we incorporate emotional resonance and embodiment can profound and sustained personal transformation take place. Organizations that master these integrated practices will lead future innovation and creativity.”  
In a Nutshell:  
• Use evocative images to surface intuitive motives.  
• Transform these motives into emotionally meaningful mottos.  
• Employ neuroscience-informed embodied practices to deeply embed new behaviors.  
• Regularly refine, practice, and integrate insights for sustainable growth.  
By harnessing the Zürcher Ressourcen Modell, you enable profound alignment of heart, mind, and body, fostering long-term behavioral change that is not merely imposed by discipline but authentically chosen by the deeper layers of your being.

## DOCUMENT 30: HOW TO ESCAPE ANXIETY OVERDRIVE: THE POWER OF RITUAL FOR LEADERSHIP

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to escape Anxiety Overdrive: The power of Ritual for Leadership  
Sometimes we are so occupied with what has to happen in the future that we forget to inhabit the now.   
As a CEO your job is to predict the future and to navigate towards a favorable outcome for the organization.  
This “future focus” comes with downsides: A leader that only lives in the “future”  
goes on anxiety overdrive very fast  
misses important intelligence markers in the body or emotions  
Is not grounded and cant be “felt” by his team  
Your “future focus” becomes a liability.   
As a result, you can loose grip over your team, miss important information and worse, be so trapped in the “worrying mind overdrive” that you cant see the real possibility in front of you.   
How can I learn to escape anxiety overdrive?  
It starts with learning to move from “tomorrow” to the now: The move from thinking obsesively to feeling and observing.   
Enter the power of ritual:

A ritual is a symbolic activity or series of actions, performed with intentionality and regularity, that holds cultural, spiritual, psychological, or social significance.  
Ultimately, a ritual transforms an ordinary action into an extraordinary moment, imbuing daily life with a sense of purpose, depth, and reflection.  
Organizations can use the power of ritual in profound ways. 

I once visited plum village, a influential modern zen monastery in France. While talking with one of the head monks, i heard a loud bell ringing. She stopped talking, closed her eyes, centered herself, and after 20 seconds of mindfulness she continued the conversation. I was struck. 

Plum village’s core value of mindfulness was so important to them that they build a randomized digital bell all over the monastery, in order to have many moments of “collecting yourself” sprinkled throughout the day. Whenever that bell would ring (and ring it would often) everything and everyone stopped. 20 seconds later everyone would continue their ways, but this time a little bit more centered and connected with themselves.   
How can you harness the power of ritual?  
You can start small:   
I often gift CEOs i work with a special tea pot, or a coffee grinder to start to practice the “power of ritual”:   
Tea Person: If you are a tea person get a gaiwan ( a walnut shaped chinese tea pot, forcing you to pay attention), source excellent chinese or japanese tea (spend heavily) and follow the instructions below.  
Coffee person: If you are a coffee person get a great handgrinder (commandante is best), source excellent filter coffee, a v60 filter and try the recipe below.  
Daily rituals structure human experiences, providing a sense of meaning, connection, and continuity.   
You can make your rituals as powerful or shallow as you want. 

Try out rituals. And let me know which one landed best.  
Yours, 

Nikolas  
☕️ The Ritual of Perfect Filter Coffee  
“Great coffee is equal parts science, ritual, and poetry.” — James Hoffmann, coffee expert and author of The World Atlas of Coffee  
Ingredients & Equipment  
Fresh specialty coffee beans (medium roast, single-origin recommended)  
Filtered or bottled water  
Grinder (burr grinder strongly recommended)  
Kitchen scale  
Brewing device: Hario V60, Kalita Wave, or Chemex  
Paper filters  
Kettle with gooseneck spout  
Timer  
A mindful presence (optional, but transformative)  
🥄   
Step 1: Preparation & Ratio  
Ratio: 1g coffee : 16g water  
(Example: 20g coffee, 320g water)  
Adjust slightly for personal taste: more coffee for intensity, more water for lighter nuance.  
Bring water temperature to 92–96°C (198–205°F). Cooler water highlights fruity notes; hotter water emphasizes body and depth.  
🌀   
Step 2: The Grind  
Grind fresh beans right before brewing.  
Aim for a medium-fine grind resembling sea salt (finer for V60, slightly coarser for Chemex).  
Why freshness?  
Aromatic compounds are volatile, dissipating quickly once beans are ground. Grinding fresh preserves complexity.  
🌸   
Step 3: Bloom  
Place filter paper in brewer; rinse gently with hot water to remove papery taste and preheat vessel.  
Add ground coffee, gently level the coffee bed.  
Start your timer. Pour twice the coffee’s weight in water to saturate grounds (e.g., 40g water for 20g coffee).  
Allow a 30-second bloom, letting CO₂ escape. Observe the coffee “bloom”—this ritual reveals freshness.  
Why bloom?  
Degassing ensures even extraction by releasing trapped gases, creating clarity and harmony in flavor.  
🌊   
Step 4: Brewing (The Spiral Dance)  
After bloom, pour water steadily in concentric spirals from center to edges.  
Maintain a gentle, consistent flow, avoiding contact with the paper filter.  
Pause briefly when nearing your desired total water weight, completing the pour between 2:00–2:30 minutes.  
⏳   
Step 5: Patience & Mindfulness  
Total brewing time: 3:00–3:30 minutes.  
A shorter extraction brings brightness and acidity; a longer one deepens sweetness and body.  
Use this time to tune into aromas, the rhythm of dripping, and your own breath. A ritual is about presence, making a humble moment profound.  
🍵   
Step 6: Serve & Savor  
Gently swirl coffee in the vessel before pouring to harmonize flavors.  
Let coffee cool slightly (60–70°C/140–158°F).  
Cooler coffee reveals greater complexity and subtlety.  
Sip mindfully, noting evolving aromas, flavors, body, and aftertaste.

The Art of Brewing High-Class Green Tea  
“Tea is quiet, and our thirst for tea is never far from our craving for beauty.”  
— James Norwood Pratt, renowned tea scholar  
🍵   
Ingredients & Tools  
High-quality loose-leaf green tea  
Examples: Gyokuro, Sencha, Longjing (Dragonwell), or delicate Anji Bai Cha  
Filtered, spring, or soft bottled water  
Tea kettle with precise temperature control or thermometer  
Brewing vessel:  
Traditional Kyusu (Japanese teapot), Gaiwan, or elegant glass teapot  
Scale (recommended)  
Small ceramic cup or glassware (for visual pleasure)  
Quiet attention (essential)  
⚖️   
Step 1: Precision in Ratio & Preparation  
Use approximately 2g tea leaves per 100ml water.  
(E.g., 4–6g tea leaves for a standard 200–300ml brewing.)  
Preheat your brewing vessel and cups with hot water to maintain optimal temperature.  
🌡   
Step 2: Temperature—The Delicate Dance  
Ideal temperatures for green teas vary subtly:  
Gyokuro (shaded teas): 50–60°C (122–140°F)  
Sweetness and umami at lower temperatures.  
Sencha & Chinese greens (Longjing): 70–80°C (158–176°F)  
Highlights freshness and aromatic complexity.  
Why low temperature?  
Excessive heat extracts bitter polyphenols; lower temperatures ensure a balanced, nuanced brew.  
🌱   
Step 3: Measuring the Moment  
Add tea leaves to preheated brewing vessel.  
Gently inhale fragrance of dry leaves—acknowledge subtleties of freshness, sweetness, grassy depth.  
Pour carefully heated water over leaves.  
Steep briefly, observing the leaves unfurl:  
Gyokuro: 90–120 seconds  
Sencha: 60–90 seconds  
Longjing: 60–120 seconds  
Why short steeping?  
Brief steeping captures essence without harshness, maximizing umami and delicate aromas.  
🌊   
Step 4: Pouring with Grace  
Pour brewed tea evenly into your cups, gently alternating, to ensure consistency of flavor.  
(Traditional Japanese tea ceremony emphasizes serving every drop to avoid bitterness in later brews.)  
Observe color clarity—from pale jade to luminous emerald, as visual aesthetics enhance sensory delight.  
🍃   
Step 5: Multiple Infusions—Layers of Flavor  
High-quality green tea leaves are not single-use; they unfold in multiple infusions:  
Infusion  
Water Temperature  
Steeping Time  
1st  
See above  
1–2 min  
2nd  
Slightly hotter \+5°C  
30–60 sec  
3rd+  
Slightly hotter again  
45–90 sec

Each infusion reveals different nuances: first umami-rich, second balanced, third floral, gentle sweetness.  
🍵   
Step 6: Mindful Enjoyment  
Hold cup with both hands; feel warmth.  
Inhale deeply, appreciating shifting aromas.  
Sip slowly, letting tea linger on palate. Experience sensations evolving from initial umami and sweetness to gentle vegetal or floral finish.  
Why mindfulness?  
Tea drinking transcends mere hydration—it becomes a quiet dialogue with oneself, nature, and aesthetics.  
📖   
Tea Wisdom  
“Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world revolves—slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.”

DOCUMENT 31: THE LEITMOTIF PRINCIPLE  
The Three Traits of High Performers  
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to Recognize If You Are a High Performer: The "Leitmotif Principle" or the Three Traits of High Performers

Life can be magic. Or it can be accidental.

Most high performers I work with display three traits following a hidden principle that guides their life:

They have a relentless point of view, seeing their life as their story. I call this the "Leitmotif principle", which shows "authorship" by guiding their lives by three traits. 

People who follow the leitmotiv principle see their life through this lens:

You're the hero of your own narrative, not because you're infallible, but because you willingly step into roles that require you to confront and overcome immense challenges.

Your life unfolds as a series of trials, each challenge, and hardship representing another chapter in your ongoing story. 

The people around you become significant characters in this narrative, and every obstacle is an opportunity for growth—not just for yourself but for everyone involved.

High performers avoid a common trap that writer Milan Kundera perfectly describes:  
"You can't blame a novel for being fascinated by the mysterious happenings of co-incidences, making a coherent story. But you can blame humans for being blind to their occurrence in everyday life."

He points out that most people fail to see the meaning. I noticed that if you are a "High Performer," you don't fall into this trap:

You see destiny where others see coincidence.

A story unfolds before your eyes: You are driven by your "Leitmotif."

I call someone a "high performer" because they exhibit three traits better than the rest of the room. Here is how you can spot if you are a high performer:

1\. You Position Yourself at the Epicenter of the Problem

You don't shy away from challenges; instead, you actively seek them out. You place yourself in situations where the stakes are high, often becoming the "eye of the storm" in a metaphorical tornado.

This isn't about creating problems for drama's sake but choosing almost insurmountable battles. The sheer scale of these problems ensures that solving them requires not just your effort but also the mobilization of teams, resources, and often the rethinking of existing paradigms.

By embracing the chaos, you orchestrate solutions others might deem impossible. Centering yourself on the problem allows you to become the axis around which everything else revolves, ensuring you remain in control of both the narrative and the outcomes.

2\. You relentlessly Focus on What Is Within Your Control

Amid challenges, you maintain an extraordinary focus on what you can control. While others might be paralyzed by opinions, judgments, or uncontrollable variables, you hone in on actionable items within your sphere of influence.

This focus isn't just a survival tactic; it's a strategic approach. By zeroing in on controllable factors, you mitigate the overwhelming nature of problems and maintain clarity and direction.

This trait sets apart those who achieve great things from those sidetracked by external noise. It's a form of mental resilience critical for navigating the unpredictable terrain of leadership.

3\. You Regulate Your Ego in high-stakes situations like no other

The most subtle yet powerful trait you can possess is the ability to regulate your ego.

You grasp that clinging to a fixed identity or a particular narrative about yourself can be limiting. You're able to set aside your ego when necessary, allowing you to adapt to new information, pivot strategies, and build trust within your teams.

By detaching from your ego, you foster open-mindedness and cultivate a culture of trust and cooperation. It's a leadership superpower that enables you to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics without being hindered by pride or rigid self-concepts.

The Leitmotif: These principles need nurturing

When these three characteristics come together, they form the leitmotif—the recurring theme in your life story:

• You Position Yourself at the Epicenter of the Problem  
• You relentlessly Focus on What Is Within Your Control    
• You Regulate Your Ego in high-stake situations like no other

Most high-performers are not aware that they exhibit these traits innately.

While these traits might seem inherent to most extreme high performers I have worked with, they need cultivation. If they are not being nurtured, they can wither.

The Leitmotif Principle isn't just a framework for understanding high performers; it's a blueprint for any CEO aspiring to achieve significant impact. I recommend putting them up center in your own journey:

By placing yourself in challenging situations, focusing on what you can control, and regulating your ego, you can cultivate these qualities through experience, training, and reflection.

By embracing these characteristics, you can craft your own powerful narrative, stepping into the role of the hero in the ongoing story of your life.

By internalizing these principles, you continue to lead with purpose, resilience, and adaptability—qualities that define success and inspire those around you to reach their highest potential.

Inspirations: This writing emerged following long conversations with Engin Ayaz (CEO ATÖLYE) and Bernd Kessel (CEO Kessel & Kessel), whose thinking inspired these principles.

## DOCUMENT 31: THE TRUST FORMULA

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Secret Behind High Performing Teams.  
The Trust Formula:  
"Companies move at the speed of trust."  
Here is the formula I use to help CEOs to scale their organizations to move at the speed of trust.  
Charles H. Green's trust formula simplifies the abstract notion of trust into measurable components (taken from the business classic "The Trusted Advisor").  
Role-model the formula to build high-trust environments.  
Here it is:  
Trustworthiness= Self−Orientation(Credibility+Reliability+Intimacy)  
Let’s unpack this:  
1\. Credibility 📚:  
"Credibility comes from the Latin, credibilis, which means 'worthy to be believed.'"  
\-\> Be genuine, knowledgeable, and an expert in your field.  
2\. Reliability 🕒:  
"Reliability has to do with actions. It's the track record you establish by either following through on the things you say you're going to do – or not."  
\-\> Keep promises and be consistent in your actions.  
3\. Intimacy 💬:  
"Intimacy refers to the safety or security that we feel when entrusting someone with something."  
\-\> Foster safe environments where openness is encouraged.  
4\. Self-Orientation ↔️:  
"If your focus is on the other person, then paradoxically your trustworthiness increases."  
\-\> Prioritize the collective benefit over personal gains.  
Trust must be earned:  
"You must do something to give the other people the evidence on which they can base their decision on whether to trust you. "  
\- David Maister/Charles Green  
Let's sum it up.  
When your words, actions, emotions, and motives match, you are more likely to be trusted:  
1\. Credibility (Words) I can trust what he says about...  
2\. Reliability (Actions) I can trust her to..  
3\. Intimacy (Emotions) I feel comfortable discussing this...  
4\. Self-orientation (Motives) I can trust that he cares about...  
Reflect:  
What helps you to trust someone?

## DOCUMENT 32: DRAMA TRIANGLE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Most leaders get caught up in the "Drama Triangle":  
They blame others, insist on being right, or play the "victim card."  
Getting stuck in Drama has serious consequences:  
→ You destroy trust  
→ Your relationships worsen  
→ You endanger the future of what you have built  
How can you get trapped in the drama triangle?  
The Drama Triangle has three roles:  
1\. Hero   
2\. Villain   
3\. Victim  
A. THE HERO  
Provides "temporary relief."  
The hero gives the hungry man a bagel instead of teaching him how to bake.  
\- Creates temporary, short-term relief  
\- Seeks value by being needed by others  
\- Invites dependency (from others)  
B. THE VILLAIN  
Blames himself or others  
The Villain blames oneself or others for problems, often criticizing and oppressing others to maintain control.  
\- Blames himself or others: ("I should have.."; The problem wouldn't exist if you…")   
\- Controls others (or self) through blame, criticism, and oppression  
\- Thinks he must win at any cost  
C. THE VILLAIN  
Is at the effect of  
The Victim feels powerless and at the mercy of circumstances, avoiding responsibility for their actions and outcomes.  
\- Not in control of any outcome  
\- Refrains from taking responsibility for outcomes  
\- Thinks he is powerless and at the mercy of life's circumstances  
All dramas are a race towards who gets to be the biggest victim.  
Awareness of these roles is the first step to getting out of drama.  
How?  
1\. Become aware of the drama triangle roles  
2\. Shift to a role that frees you from Drama  
Being aware of your role, you can change course:  
a) The Victim becomes the Creator:  
→ Creators take responsibility for their lives & ask for help.  
b) The Villain becomes the Challenger:   
→ Challengers bring healthy pressure to create breakthroughs.  
c) The Hero becomes the Coach:   
→ The coach empowers others through inquiry.   
Summary: How to move from Drama to Presence.   
Escape Drama by moving from:  
a) Victim to Creator   
b) Hero to Coach   
c) Villain to Challenger  
Reflect: What has helped you escape unnecessary drama?

## DOCUMENT 34: HANDLE MISTAKES

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

All leaders make mistakes.  
How to not make a bad situation worse:  
You know if you can trust someone by seeing how they act when they make a mistake.  
Most people try to cover up their mistakes:  
\-\> They shift blame  
\-\> They hide the truth  
\-\> They cover their responsibility  
The problem:  
Not owning your mistakes erodes trust and can lead to even bigger disasters.  
The truth is:  
Handling a mistake with dignity lets you get closer to the person you want to be.  
Here are Shane Parrish's 4 steps on how to handle a mistake:  
1\. Accept responsibilities  
Acknowledge any contribution to a mistake. Take responsibility for what happens afterward.  
\-\> Keep your emotions in check: Understand that you don't need to "safe" face  
\-\> Own your part and the result: don't play blame games  
\-\> Build a habit of acknowledging responsibility  
2\. Learn from the mistake  
Reflect on how you contributed to the error.  
\-\> Understand what thoughts, feelings, and actions contributed  
\-\> Identify the problem's causes  
\-\> Accept responsibility fully by understanding the cause  
3\. Commit to doing better  
Formulate a plan for doing better and follow through.  
\-\> Build strength by establishing more self-accountability  
\-\> Plan how you could do better in the future  
\-\> Follow the plan to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past  
4\. Repair the damage as best as you can  
If possible, repair the damage caused by the mistake.  
\-\> Be consistent in doing better  
\-\> Be patient: not all mistakes can be repaired  
\-\> Accept mistakes to remove their grip on your future  
"Mistakes turn into anchors if you don't accept them. Part of accepting them is learning from them and then letting them go."  
Shane Parrish  
We can't change the past, but we can work to undo its effects on the future by handling mistakes with these 4 steps:  
1\. Accept responsibilities  
2\. Learn from the mistake  
3\. Commit to doing better  
4\. Repair the damage as best as you can  
Reflect:  
Whose handling of a mistake inspires you?

## DOCUMENT 35: DYSFUNCTIONS OF TEAMS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Most teams don't live up to their potential.  
Dysfunctional behaviors them back.  
As a result, each team member   
→ lacks ownership  
→ doesn't show up fully  
→ and loses motivation.  
Tackle and transform these dysfunctions to become a high-trust/high-performance team.  
Here are the 5 dysfunctions of teams (compiled by management thinker Patrick Lencioni) we look at when analyzing the potential of leadership teams.  
1\. ABSENCE OF TRUST  
Team members don't trust each other. A lack of psychological safety makes it impossible to show your whole self.  
→ Needs: Ability to be vulnerable without losing safety.  
2\. FEAR OF CONFLICT  
Because of a lack of trust, dysfunctional teams don't dare to go into courageous conflict. Veiled comments and back-channel gossip become the norm. Artificial harmony hides the elephants in the room.  
→ Needs: Engaging in unfiltered, passionate debate about critical issues  
3\. LACK OF COMMITMENT  
Team members can't commit and buy into decisions without going into conflict. Ambiguity over many things hinders progress.  
→ Needs: Clarity and clear roles  
4\. AVOIDANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY  
When teams don't commit, they stop holding each other accountable.   
Without accountability, team members naturally look out for their interests above all.  
→ Needs: clear standards of performance and accountability  
5\. INATTENTION TO RESULTS  
Missing accountability, team members don't prioritize the team's success over departmental needs. Their focus lies on personal success rather than team achievement.  
→ Needs: Focusing on the best result for the team as a whole.  
Do you notice the pattern?  
Each failure builds on the previous dysfunction.  
To build a healthy functioning team, you need to address each level.  
I have seen it over and over: showing up and looking at your dysfunctions with a coach drastically improves the effectiveness of every team.  
In summary, these 5 dysfunctions hold you back from becoming a high-performing team:  
1\. Absence of Trust  
2\. Fear of Conflict  
3\. Lack of Commitment  
4\. Avoidance of Accountability  
5\. Inattention to Results  
What dysfunction has slowed you down?

## DOCUMENT 36: MULTIPLIERS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The best leaders make everyone perform better.  
Here is how you can too:  
Exceptional leaders don't "diminish" talent.  
They are "Multipliers."  
“Multipliers” inspire, on average, twice the capability from someone they lead.  
Why?  
Because they excel in at least one of these five roles:  
The Talent Magnet: Gets The Best Out Of Talent  
The Liberator: Requires People's Best Thinking  
The Challenger: Extends Challenges  
The Debate Maker: Debates Decisions  
The Investor: Instills Accountability  
Try these first steps to train your “Multiplier” muscle:  
START WITH YOUR ASSUMPTIONS  
→ Check your assumptions: do you default to "people will never figure this out without me" or to "people are smart and will figure it out"?  
WORK THE EXTREMES  
→ a) Neutralize a weakness of yours and b) Improve on a core strength.  
RUN EXPERIMENTS  
→ Try "spotting talents" or "making sure everyone is heard" for 60 days  
BRACE YOURSELF FOR SETBACKS  
→ Acknowledge that changing “diminishing” habits takes time  
Reflect: Which of the five “Multiplier” roles are you most familiar with?

## DOCUMENT 37: NON-VIOLENT COMMUNICATION

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to Master Difficult Conversations With Non-Violent Communication  
You can master difficult conversations without blame and drama.  
Non-violent communication (NVC) helps you resolve conflicts by  
→ identifying unmet needs  
→ finding mutually satisfactory solutions  
→ sharing requests  
Communicate with empathy.    
Facing the following difficult conversation, apply the NVC Framework to avoid unnecessary drama:  
1\. OBSERVATION  
→ Describe the situation without judgment  
→ Only share facts you both could agree on  
2\. FEELINGS  
→ Express your feelings without criticism.  
→ Remember to focus on YOUR emotions.  
3\. NEEDS  
→ Express your needs  
→ Stay calm and be as precise as possible  
4\. REQUEST  
→ Share your request so your needs can be met  
→ Your request should be specific and doable  
"Anything people hear that implies wrongness on their part prevents you from connecting with them."  
Dont blame.  
Don't communicate like this:  
→ "You are always staring at your phone when I am talking to you  
→ You are making me feel angry because you are not taking time for me.  
→ Stop staring at your phone and give me your attention."  
Do it differently.  
Apply Non-Violent Communication instead:  
→ "When you look at your phone while talking to me (Observation)  
→ I feel irritated (Observation)  
→ Because I don't feel heard by you. (Needs)  
→ Would you be willing to look at me when I talk to you? (Request)"  
In summary, to master difficult conversations with Non-Violent Communication, go for:  
→ Observation without evaluation  
→ Feelings rather than interpretations  
→ Needs that are causing those feelings  
→ Requests instead of demands  
What has helped you to master difficult conversations?

## DOCUMENT 38: HOW TO GET THE HEARTBEAT RIGHT: THE 4 MOST IMPORTANT MEETINGS TO ACE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Meetings can be the slow death of your organization.  
Here is how to get them right:  
Meetings get a bad rep.  
But, meetings are not at fault.  
You are.  
As a CEO, you have to take advantage of the 3 most powerful tools to get to team performance (@Verne Harnish):  
Peer Pressure  
Collective Intelligence  
Clear Communication  
Your Meetings are boring and unproductive because they need more drama and context.  
A meeting should    
\- keep participants engaged  
\- harvest for productive conflict  
\- serve a strategic purpose in the organization.

Getting meetings right brings focus, pace, and alignment.  
They help you to solve problems quickly.  
To get this right, you need four types of meetings, each with a specific focus and rhythm.  
This rhythm is backed by leading management thinkers like Patrick Lencioni & Verne Harnish.  
The Daily Check-In, Weekly Tactical, Monthly Strategic, and Quarterly Off-site Review.  
Daily Check-In:   
These are brief (5-10 minute) meetings to align on the day's activities and share critical updates, fostering transparency and daily engagement.  
Weekly Tactical:   
These meetings focus on tactical issues of immediate concern, allowing teams to address obstacles and align on weekly goals and metrics.   
They should be crisp, focusing solely on resolving issues that affect the near term.  
Monthly Strategic:   
Longer meetings dedicated to discussing, debating, and deciding on critical issues that affect the organization's long-term success. These sessions ensure that strategic initiatives progress and adapt as needed.  
Quarterly Off-site Review:   
These deeper dives allow for reflection, strategic planning, and team building. They are crucial for stepping back from daily operations to reassess goals, strategies, and team health.  
A "focused" meeting structure can transform meetings into invaluable tools for   
driving  
\- alignment,   
\- clarity,  
\- and engagement.  
The key is embracing conflict and engaging in lively debates during meetings, which can help make more thoroughly vetted and, ultimately, more effective decisions.  
In summary:  
As a CEO, your most significant tools are Peer Pressure, Collective Intelligence & Clear Communication.  
To set the pace (heartbeat) for performance, you need to get these meetings right:  
The Daily Check-In,   
Weekly Tactical,   
Monthly Strategic,   
Quarterly Off-site Review.  
What is the best way to approach meetings in your experience?

## DOCUMENT 39: HOW TO MAP YOUR CULTURE: THE CULTURE DIAGNOSTICS MODEL

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

As a CEO, navigating the complexities of culture can often feel vague and challenging.   
The Culture Diagnostics model, based on the Hawthorne dimensions (Fatzer 2005), offers a clear framework to help you assess and understand the cultural dynamics of your organization.   
It focuses on two key areas: Concern for People and Concern for Task, resulting in four distinct culture types—each with its own strengths and challenges.  
This model is powerful because it helps you identify where your organization stands today.   
Are you too focused on tasks and performance, perhaps at the cost of your team's well-being (Pressing Culture)?  
 Or are you creating an environment full of empathy and care but lacking the drive to achieve results (Caring Culture)?  
 There may be a worrying lack of both people care and task orientation (Apathetic Culture).  
The ideal culture for a growing organization—the one that drives sustainable growth—is the Integrative Culture.   
This is where strong care for your team aligns with a strong focus on achieving goals. In this culture, your people feel supported, motivated, and purposeful while staying productive.  
 As a CEO, aiming for this culture helps you balance performance demands with the humanity of your workforce, allowing you to build a resilient, high-performing organization.  
The Culture Diagnostics model acts as a map.   
It shows you where you are now and provides a visual guide on where you need to go.   
By recognizing which quadrant your current culture falls into, you can make informed decisions on what to improve—whether it’s increasing support for your team to balance a task-heavy culture or introducing accountability systems to drive outcomes in a caring but underperforming environment.  
Ultimately, culture can be a lever for growth rather than a challenge.   
By using this model, you can create intentional cultural shifts that align your people's well-being with your strategic goals—building a workplace that not only succeeds but also inspires.

## DOCUMENT 40: HOW TO UNDERSTAND YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DNA: THE "4 CULTURES MAP"?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to understand your Organization's DNA:  
Where are you on the "The 4 Organizational Cultures" map?  
Most inexperienced CEOs don't know their organization’s DNA.   
As a result, they hire the wrong people, make promises they can’t keep, and create fluffy, complicated organizations.  
This is why I usually spend a lot of time helping them figure out what their organization is. And above all, what it isnt?  
Know thyself.   
And you will have an advantage over your competitors.  
Great family organization like Bahlsen (yes, the cookies) knows they are not McKinsey. And they know it would be deadly if they tried to be.   
The "4 Organizational Cultures" model provides clarity by measuring your organization along two essential axes: People Orientation and Performance Orientation.  
When you scale your company, you need to understand two metrics above everything else:  
People Orientation reflects how strongly your organization prioritizes employees' well-being, engagement, and satisfaction.  
Performance Orientation measures the extent to which your organization values results, productivity, and achievement.  
By assessing these axes, four distinct organizational cultures emerge:  
Caring Culture (Strong People Orientation, Weak Performance Orientation)  
In Caring Cultures, employee well-being reigns supreme. Organizations here deeply value relationships, trust, and supportive environments.  
Typical Example: Family-owned businesses, community-focused nonprofits  
Pros: High employee loyalty, strong emotional bonds  
Cons: Potential for complacency, lack of rigorous performance standards  
Apathetic Culture (Weak People Orientation, Weak Performance Orientation)  
Organizations with an Apathetic Culture fail to prioritize either performance or employee well-being. They are often bureaucratic, rigid, and disengaged.  
Typical Example: Government bureaucracies or stagnant corporations  
Pros: Predictability, stability  
Cons: Low morale, high turnover, limited innovation  
Driver Culture (Weak People Orientation, Strong Performance Orientation)  
Driver Cultures relentlessly pursue high performance, often at the expense of employee well-being. These organizations emphasize results, productivity, and competition.  
Typical Example: High-intensity consulting firms (e.g., McKinsey)  
Pros: High productivity, clear achievement metrics  
Cons: Burnout risk, turnover, diminished long-term employee satisfaction  
Inclusive Culture (Strong People Orientation, Strong Performance Orientation)  
Inclusive Cultures strike a delicate balance, equally valuing employee well-being and organizational performance. They strive for holistic success, understanding that performance thrives when people feel valued and supported.  
Typical Example: Forward-thinking tech companies like Airbnb or DeepMind  
Pros: Sustainable high performance, innovative potential, engaged workforce  
Cons: Requires careful, ongoing balance to maintain equilibrium  
To position your company strategically, ask yourself:  
Where does your organization currently stand on this map?  
Where do your employees think you stand?  
—-----------  
Old:  
Hi Mindful CEO,   
When I begin my work with CEOs, I use the "4 Cultures Map" to map where their organization is.  
When you scale your company, you need to understand two metrics above everything else:  
a) People Orientation:   
→ How much are people valued in my organization?  
b) Performance Orientation:   
→ How much is performance valued in my organization?  
Your preferences for people and performance as a leader are the building blocks of your company culture.  
Without an understanding of your preferences, you will:  
a) hire the wrong people  
b) create the wrong incentive structures  
c) mindlessly design a culture that doesn't fit you.  
You need to understand where you place yourself on the 4 types of organizational cultures.  
Here they are:  
Caring Culture  
People and their well-being matter above everything else.  
Example: Family Organizations  
Apathetic Culture  
Neither the well-being nor the performance of the workforce is considered important.  
Example: Bureaucratic Institutions  
Driver Culture  
Performance is the most important metric. Well-being and people's quality of life are secondary.  
Example: McKinsey  
Inclusive Culture  
People's well-being and their performance are equally valued.  
Example: AirBnB, Deep Mind  
When I begin my work with CEOs, I use the "4 Culture Map" to ask these three questions:  
Where do you place your organization?  
Where do your employees place your organization?  
Where do you want your organization to be in 2 years?    
This analysis gives me a deep understanding of  
a) the CEO's cultural preferences  
b) how working in that organization feels  
c) the direction we need to design for.  
Let’s recap:  
The 4 cultures are a helpful guide to understanding your status quo and direction as you are growing your organization:   
Caring Culture  
Apathetic Culture  
Driver Culture  
Inclusive Culture  
Where do you place yourself?

## DOCUMENT 41: HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE RIGHT TEAM: THE TEAM ONE CONCEPT

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Prioritizing the Right Team  
One of the most important things that members of a leadership team must do is understand which team is their top priority.   
If you were to ask any leader in an organization which team is their top priority  
the team they’re a member of that runs the organization,   
or the team they lead in their department—  
many would admit (and understandably so) that their top priority is the team they lead, not the one they’re a member of.  
It kind of looks like this:  
	•	If this is the leadership team, and each member runs their own department, it is natural for them to prioritize their own team over the leadership team or executive team.  
However, as natural and understandable as this is, it’s very dangerous in an organization.   
When every member prioritizes the team they lead over the one they’re a part of, the leadership team becomes like the United Nations or Congress, where everyone lobbies for their own constituents instead of coming together to make decisions for the good of the entire organization.  
Common Objections from Leaders  
When I confront leaders about this, their first objection is often:  
“How will my department feel when they find out they are no longer my top priority?”  
Here’s the funny thing about that: Do you know who wants the leadership team to be the number one priority more than anyone else? It’s the people who work in these departments. Why?  
	•	When the leadership team is not working together, and the leaders have not made this group their top priority, their teams are left to fight bloody and unwinnable battles with one another.  
	•	If the leadership team hasn’t resolved their own differences and left meetings with clear marching orders, their departments cannot possibly succeed.  
Why Leaders Prioritize Their Own Teams  
So why do these leaders make their own teams their top priority?  
	•	They spend more time with their own teams.  
	•	They have hired these people.  
	•	They enjoy being the leader of that group.  
	•	It’s often their functional area of expertise.  
But leaders need to overcome this inclination. Until they can step into the leadership room, leave their departments behind, and become executives for the entire organization, they will never create a healthy organization.  
By shifting focus from their own teams to the leadership team, executives foster greater alignment and success for the entire company.  
Source: Patrick Lencioni, here  
What does an aligned leadership team look like?  
A leadership team should function as an organization’s primary, cohesive team.   
The executive team (Team One) must prioritize the company’s needs over the interests of individual departments or functions.   
Aligned leadership teams share an obsession with these 6 principles.  
The 6 Principles of Aligned Leadership:   
	1\.	Prioritizing the Executive Team:  
The most important team for any executive is not the team they lead (e.g., their department), but rather the leadership team they are a part of.   
This executive team is responsible for the overall success of the organization. If executives prioritize their departmental team over the leadership team, it leads to silos, misalignment, and competition within the organization.  
	2\.	Collective Responsibility:  
Members of the leadership team must view themselves as part of a collective body whose responsibility is the organization’s overall health, rather than just their individual department’s success.   
This means making decisions that benefit the entire company, even if they conflict with their department’s short-term interests.  
	3\.	Cross-functional Collaboration:  
Effective collaboration across departments is critical.   
When Team One aligns around shared goals and values, they create a culture where cross-functional collaboration trickles down through the entire organization, breaking down silos and fostering unity.  
	4\.	Alignment on Key Priorities:  
Team One must be aligned on key organizational priorities. Without alignment at the top, the rest of the organization becomes fragmented. Lencioni encourages executives to spend significant time ensuring that they share a common understanding of goals, strategies, and values.  
	5\.	Commitment and Accountability:  
Members of Team One must hold themselves and each other accountable, committing fully to the agreed-upon goals of the organization. In Lencioni’s model, this means candid conversations, healthy conflict, and a shared commitment to mutual accountability.  
	6\.	Vulnerability-based Trust:  
Vulnerability-based trust as the foundation of any high-performing team. Team One members must be comfortable being open, admitting mistakes, and relying on one another without fear of judgment or competition. This level of trust enables constructive conflict and decision-making.  
Practical Implications:  
The Team One concept is about shifting mindsets at the executive level.   
Instead of viewing themselves as defenders of their individual departments, executives must commit to the organization’s broader success. For companies scaling rapidly or navigating significant growth, this concept helps maintain alignment and coherence at the leadership level, preventing power struggles or miscommunication.  
In summary, Lencioni’s Team One concept encourages leaders to think of themselves as a unified front, responsible for steering the entire organization, rather than advocating solely for their department.

## DOCUMENT 42: HOW TO ESCAPE THE LEADER'S TRAP: WHEN SELF-RELIANCE BECOMES SELF-SABOTAGE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to escape the The Self-Reliance Spiral: When Self-Reliance Becomes Self-Sabotage  
There's a painful paradox many leaders face.  
The very traits that helped them build success become the ones that limit their growth.  
I call it "The Self-Reliance Spiral"     
Here's what it looks like:  
A founder stays late every Saturday while their team goes home at 5pm.   
A CEO takes on operational work because "it's faster if I just do it myself."  
An executive rewrites reports instead of coaching the person who wrote them.   
Sound familiar?  
The Pattern That Kills Growth  
The trap follows a predictable cycle:  
Someone on your team underperforms. You feel the pressure of the deadline. Instead of holding them accountable, you sigh and take over the work.  
Leading Leadership coach Joe Hudson describes this phenomenon in these words:   
“..every single really successful CEO I know has a pretty heavy self-reliance streak. But they have to overcome, in part, to have a great team. Because if they're too self-reliant, they're micromanagers, they don't, they can't attract great talent. They can't delegate well”.   
You tell yourself you're being practical. You're saving time. You're ensuring quality.  
But you're actually creating three problems:  
→ Personal burnout (working until 11pm while your team rests)  
→ Team stagnation (they never learn to step up)  
→ Deepening isolation (you prove to yourself, again, that you can only rely on you)  
The most painful part? You recognize the pattern. You see yourself caught in it. But you can't seem to stop.  
The Hidden Root: Extreme Self-Reliance  
At the core of this trap lies a belief: "I only trust myself."  
This isn't confidence. It's a defense mechanism.  
I've seen this pattern emerge from two sources:  
Professional betrayal. A business partner who secretly plotted to push you out. A co-founder who shared your strategy with competitors. Years of legal battles that made your stomach turn every time your lawyer's name appeared in your inbox.  
Family legacy. Growing up in environments where the hardest truths were never spoken. Where vulnerability was weakness. Where the only safety was self-sufficiency.  
These experiences don't just hurt. They reshape how you lead.  
The leader who carries this wound faces a cruel irony: trying to avoid disappointment and loneliness by doing everything themselves, they guarantee both outcomes.  
Why the Self-Reliance Spiral Destroys Accountability  
Here's what new leaders often miss:  
Extreme self-reliance and accountability cannot coexist.  
When you constantly step in to do the work yourself, you rob your team of something essential: the opportunity to be responsible for results.  
One leader I worked with received this feedback from his team: "His greatest asset is his empathy. But this can be a disadvantage by being too indulgent. He has to stand his ground and demand that it will be done."  
Notice the tension? Care without accountability creates indulgence, not empowerment.  
Your team needs you to hold them to standards. When you don't, they learn that underperformance is acceptable. They learn that you'll always be the safety net. They never develop the muscle of true ownership.  
The Path Forward  
Breaking this cycle doesn't start with better delegation skills or time management hacks.  
It starts with honest self-reflection:  
Question your beliefs. Do you truly believe your team cannot handle the work? Or are you protecting yourself from the risk of being let down again?  
Examine your history. What experiences taught you that self-reliance was the only safe strategy? How might those lessons be limiting you now?  
Separate past from present. The betrayal you experienced was real. But is your current team actually untrustworthy? Or are you projecting old wounds onto new relationships?  
Start small. Choose one area where you'll resist the urge to take over. Set clear expectations. Let someone else own the outcome, even if it's imperfect.  
The goal isn't to stop caring or to become hands-off. It's to distinguish between empowerment and abandonment, between accountability and control.  
The Choice Before You  
Every time you face an underperforming team member, you have a choice:  
Take over the work and reinforce the pattern that isolates you.  
Or hold the difficult conversation, set clear expectations, and trust the process of growth (yours and theirs).  
The second path is harder. It requires you to sit with the discomfort of uncertainty. To risk disappointment. To believe that people can rise to meet your standards if you give them the chance.  
But it's the only path that leads somewhere different.  
The trap feels safe because it's familiar. You know how to work harder. You know how to rely on yourself. You've survived this way.  
The question is: do you want to keep surviving, or do you want to build something bigger than what one person can carry alone?  
Your team is waiting to see which path you'll choose.  
Reflection: Where in your leadership are you defaulting to "I'll just do it myself"? What would become possible if you chose differently?

## DOCUMENT 43: HOW TO SPOT THE 4 RELATIONSHIP KILLERS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to spot the 4 relationship killers \- 4 ways to avoid slowly killing your organization  
Here is the most effective way to kill your organization:

Eroding Relationships\!  
I have been called to fix many uncomfortable situations:  
Co-founders that stop speaking with each other.  
Leadership team members screaming insults to the CEO.

Investors suing their asses, because of broken pride.  
You don't want to go down that route.   
You don’t want to call someone in to help mend what didn't have to break. .   
And you dont have to.   
Here are science-backed ways to fuck up a good relationship. And proven ways to avoid fucking it up in the first place:   
The four relationship killer \- aka 4 horsemen are Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling (created by relationship expert John Gottman).  
When applied to leadership, the Four killers—Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling—reflect toxic communication patterns that can undermine a leader’s effectiveness, erode team morale, and lead to organizational dysfunction.   
Here’s how each horseman might appear in a leadership context and what leaders can do to counteract these patterns:  
1\. Criticism  
Criticism in a leadership context involves blaming, personal attacks, or finding fault in others without offering constructive feedback. You point out what’s wrong with the “person” rather than focusing on a specific behavior or outcome.  
Example: You use a fixed mindset phrasing:“You always mess up presentations. You’re just not detail-oriented enough,” instead of addressing the issue objectively: “The last presentation had some errors—let’s look at how we can improve this moving forward.”  
Impact: Unconstructive Criticism from a leader can lead to a culture of fear and blame. It discourages risk-taking, damages trust, and can create a defensive atmosphere more focused on avoiding mistakes than achieving results.  
Antidote: Use Gentle Start-Ups: Frame feedback around behaviors and specific situations, focusing on the issue rather than the person.  
2\. Contempt  
 Contempt manifests when leaders express superiority or disrespect toward team members. It can include sarcasm, ridicule, or belittling remarks that make subordinates feel undervalued and disrespected.   
Example: You say, “Wow, I can’t believe you don’t know this. It’s so basic,” while rolling your eyes in a meeting. This makes the other feel small and hesitant to contribute further.  
Impact: Contempt signals a lack of respect and can result in widespread resentment, lower team morale, and disengagement. Over time, it leads to high employee turnover and a toxic work environment.  
Antidote: Build a Culture of Respect and Appreciation: Regularly express appreciation and respect for colleagues and ensure that positive interactions outweigh negative ones.  
3\. Defensiveness  
A defensive leader refuses to accept responsibility for mistakes, deflects blame, and often responds to feedback with excuses or counter-attacks.   
Example: When confronted about a decision that negatively impacted the team, you say, “Well, it’s not my fault—none of you gave me any good ideas. I had no choice but to do it this way.”  
Impact: Defensiveness prevents growth and creates a blame-oriented culture. It discourages open communication and can lead to a lack of psychological safety. Giving feedback or pointing out potential issues becomes pointless or dangerous.  
Antidote: Take Responsibility: Role model a culture where admitting mistakes is safe and seen as a sign of strength rather than weakness.   
4\. Stonewalling  
Stonewalling occurs when leaders emotionally withdraw, shut down, or avoid engagement when faced with difficult conversations or challenges. This can look like a leader ignoring emails, staying silent in meetings, or refusing to address conflicts directly.  
Example: You might stop attending meetings or dismiss team concerns by saying, “We’ll talk about it later,” without ever addressing the issue. This creates frustration and leaves problems unresolved.  
Impact: Stonewalling from leaders can paralyze teams and create an environment of uncertainty. It leaves employees feeling unsupported and undervalued.  
Antidote: Practice Self-Soothing and Engagement: If overwhelmed, take a break to reset, then re-engage in the discussion, focusing on constructive outcomes.  
Why the 4 Relationship Killers Matter in Leadership  
When leaders exhibit these toxic communication patterns (or horsemen), they ripple throughout the organization.   
Employees tend to mirror their leaders' behavior, so if a leader is critical, defensive, contemptuous, or disengaged, it sets the tone for the entire organization.  
To address these behaviors, you can apply these 4“antidotes”:  
	1\.	Criticism → Use Gentle Start-Ups: Frame feedback around behaviors and specific situations, focusing on the issue rather than the person.  
	2\.	Contempt → Build a Culture of Respect and Appreciation: Regularly express appreciation and respect for colleagues, and ensure that positive interactions outweigh negative ones.  
	3\.	Defensiveness → Take Responsibility: Encourage a culture where admitting mistakes is safe and seen as a sign of strength rather than weakness.  
	4\.	Stonewalling → Practice Self-Soothing and Engagement: If overwhelmed, take a break to reset, then re-engage in the discussion focusing on constructive outcomes.

## DOCUMENT 44: THE GREEK FAUCET METHOD: HOW TO MOVE BEYOND THE OBVIOUS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Greek Faucet Method: How to move beyond the obvious  
When I was a little boy, my grandfather taught me a lesson I carry with me every day.   
We stood by an old faucet in our house in a valley near the greek mountains, where he said gently,   
“Niko, the water that runs from this faucet is average and stale. But let it run for a while, and taste it. You will eventually get the pure mountain water from high above. This water is clearer and more refreshing than anything you've ever tasted."  
At first, I didn't grasp his meaning. And also thought it was a terrible waste of water.   
But over time, this simple metaphor unfolded into a way to see:  
The first things that pour out of us,ideas, words, emotions,are often murky, superficial, or obvious.   
But if we allow ourselves the patience to let these initial outpourings pass, what follows can be remarkably clear and insightful.  
I now call this "The Greek Faucet Method", in reference to my greek papous.   
In my conversations, I sometimes ask friends, "Can I just talk for five minutes straight?"  
I've learned that the first few minutes are typically filled with surface-level observations and rehearsed perspectives \- the "shitty stuff" that's been sitting stagnant in the pipes of my mind.   
But if I keep going, something magical happens.   
The mental sediment clears, and suddenly, crystal-clear thoughts begin to flow \- those "water-like insights" that remain hidden unless I create space for them to emerge.  
This principle has become central to my approach when coaching CEOs.   
The executives I work with often arrive with prepared talking points and polished perspectives.  
In our sessions, I create space for them to move beyond these initial thoughts. "Let's just talk through this for ten minutes without judgment," I'll suggest.   
Inevitably, after the rehearsed ideas and obvious solutions have been expressed, something shifts.   
The performative layer dissolves, revealing authentic concerns, innovative approaches, and breakthrough insights that had been buried beneath the surface.  
Leaders particularly benefit from this method during strategic planning and crisis management.   
Your first ideas are rarely your best.   
The faucet method gives you permission to push past quick fixes and conventional wisdom to discover truly transformative solutions.   
The method works equally well for teams. When facilitating executive retreats, I often begin with an exercise where everyone speaks unfiltered for several minutes. The initial ideas are predictable, but as the mental faucet continues running, the collective wisdom that emerges is remarkable.  
My grandfather's simple lesson by the mountain spigot has become a powerful tool that transforms how I think, how I coach, and how the leaders I work with approach their most significant challenges.   
Try it out:   
When facing complexity, remember to let the faucet run until what emerges is pure, refreshing, and unlike anything else \- the truest and most valuable insights flowing freely.

## DOCUMENT 45: WHAT MAKES A GREAT CEO? CAN YOU PASS THE CEO TEST?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

What makes a great CEO? Can you pass the CEO test?  
As you scale, your product takes off, your organization changes with every new hire, and expectations on you grow exponentially. It gets increasingly difficult to understand if you are doing a great job.  
The Harvard Business "CEO Test" lists seven key challenges all CEOs face, based on research of leadership challenges from the world's most successful organizations ranging from Microsoft to Shopify.  
Test \#1: Can You Develop a Simple Plan for Strategy? Effective leaders can distill their strategy into simple, clear terms that their team can understand and execute.  
Focus on Outcomes, rather than priorities: Define "what we need to work on" instead of "what do we need to accomplish"  
Edit ruthlessly: Create a vision everyone understands  
Set a high bar: Are you actually aiming for the moon, or are you chickening out?  
Test \#2: Can you make the Culture Real (and matter)? Are you walking the talk. Can You Create a High-Performance/High Trust Culture?  
Culture is the responsibility of the CEO and senior leaders: Define, model, enforce and assess the culture constantly  
Cultivate a positive, productive workplace culture: Performance starts with building trust  
Guard the culture: Get rid of "cultural misfits" and "toxic overachievers"  
Test \#3: Can you build Teams that Are True Teams? CEOs need to be able to assemble and motivate a high-performing team to execute their vision.  
Define the purpose of the team as a whole: Meaningful work comes through creating something bigger than each one could create  
Ensure the right people are on the team: don't tolerate substandard performance  
Be the coach: Re-invent "how" the team will work together  
Test \#4: Can you lead Transformation? The status quo is enormously powerful, and it's the enemy of change.  
Tradition needs to be constantly interrogated: How do we interpret our DNA today?  
Communicate transparently and often: reduce uncertainty through information  
Inspire key multipliers: Change happens when the right people agree to the change  
Test \#5: Can you really listen? Danger signals can be faint, and bad news travels slowly  
Be aware of the systems you operate in: know how one change affects the other  
Build a culture of 360 degree feedback: make sure people get rewarded for criticising you openly  
Listen on your toes: Your job is to get information that is relevant  
Test \#6: Can You Deal with Crises? When unexpected disasters strike, successful CEOs need to be able to lead effectively, making hard decisions quickly and efficiently.  
Show up and be human: Communicate widely. Fix root causes. Stay calm & project confidence  
Ride the urgency: Don't waste a good crisis and do what needs to be done  
Reimagine your organisation: How would you reimagine your company if you were starting it now?  
Test \#7: Can You Master the Inner Game of Being a CEO? Successful CEOs manage the psychological challenges of leadership, including self-doubt, loneliness, and the constant pressure to perform.  
Embrace ambiguity: you have to be "confident" and "humble," "compassionate" and "demanding," "optimistic" and "realistic"  
Seek a deeper understanding of yourself: get coached to develop self-awareness rooted in self-knowledge  
Recharge yourself: learn to make yourself replaceable and use pauses to gain perspective  
Summary Questions: Can you pass the CEO Test? How well do you do in those seven categories? How do others assess you? Who coached you to become the leader that you are?  
The CEO Test: Self-Assessment

## DOCUMENT 46: THE 6 STRATEGY TRAPS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to avoid painful strategy mistakes: Spot the 6 strategy traps.  
All winning strategies are unique in their insight.   
But most bad strategies have something in common.   
According to Roger L. Martin, one of the leading strategy thinkers of our time, there are 6 ways an organization can display a problematic strategy.   
Mindful CEOs are aware of the common traps they can fall with their strategies.

They look out for these six signs that they are stuck in a “strategy trap”: 

	1\.	The “Do It All” Strategy:  
You fail to make choices. Everything becomes a priority.

Solution: Strategy is choice. Take daring sets of choices to win.

	2\.	The Don Quixote Strategy:  
You attack competitive “walled cities.” You go after the strongest competitor first.

Solution: Pick where you play. Pivot to where you have a chance to win.

	3\.	The Waterloo Strategy:  
You start wars on multiple fronts at the same time.

Solution: Doing too many things weakens focus. Focus on fewer, impactful efforts.

	4\.	The “Something for Everyone” Strategy:  
You attempt to capture all consumers/channels/geographies /categories at once.  
Solution: To create real value, choose to serve some constituents really well.

	5\.	The “Dreams Never Come True” Strategy:  
You develop high-level aspirations and mission statements that never translate into action.

Solution: Choose where to play and how to win carefully.

	6\. The “program of the month” strategy:   
You settle for the same as your competitors: the same customers, the same strategy, the same choices. You look like everyone else.   
Solution: Study your unique value.  
Many organizations fail to define strategy, and even fewer know how to create a useful one. Most CEOs fall into one of these traps.   
Study these and adjust carefully.

Where have you fallen for a strategy trap?

## DOCUMENT 47: THE THREE DEATHS EVERY CEO FACES (AND HOW TO SURVIVE THEM)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Three Deaths Every CEO Faces (And How to Survive Them)  
A founder CEO told me something last month that I haven't stopped thinking about.  
"I built exactly what I set out to build," he said. "And somewhere along the way, I disappeared."  
He wasn't being dramatic. He was describing something precise. The company was thriving. The numbers looked great. And he felt like a ghost haunting his own life.  
I've heard versions of this confession dozens of times now. Different words, same shape. Something essential gets lost in the building. Something dies.  
Not physically. But really.  
After years of sitting with founders and CEOs, I've come to believe there are three deaths that wait for anyone who leads a growing company.  
They don't announce themselves. They arrive quietly, disguised as reasonable choices, as necessary sacrifices, as "just how it is."  
If you don't see them coming, they take something you can't easily get back.  
The Death of Competence  
Here's the brutal math of scaling: the company's demands increase faster than your capabilities.  
The skills that made you successful at one stage become the limitations that constrain you at the next. Your superpower of doing everything yourself, moving fast, trusting your gut? It becomes the bottleneck choking the organization.  
You hire people who know more than you do. Then you have to lead them. Convincingly.  
The gap between what you project and what you feel widens every quarter.  
This isn't imposter syndrome in the pop-psychology sense. It's structural. The job literally changes every six to twelve months. You're perpetually underqualified for the role you currently hold.  
So you start micromanaging, telling yourself you're "staying close to the details." You avoid hard conversations with executives you personally hired. You fill your calendar with tactical busywork because at least you know how to do that. You're very, very busy. Suspiciously busy.  
Underneath it all: the terror that everyone will eventually see what you already suspect about yourself.  
The founders who navigate this death share one trait. They stop trying to close the gap (you can't) and start trying to close it fast enough. They treat their own development as a real priority, not a someday-when-things-calm-down fantasy.  
Things never calm down.  
The Death of Connection  
The CEO role is a performance trap.  
You radiate confidence while navigating genuine uncertainty. Project stability to your team, optimism to investors, authority to the board, vision to candidates. Smile at the company all-hands when you're not sure you can make payroll next month.  
Every relationship slowly becomes transactional or hierarchical. Investors want returns. Board members evaluate. Executives manage up. Even co-founder dynamics get weighted with shared stakes and things you're not quite saying.  
So you perform. And the performance becomes a prison.  
You learn to share vulnerability strategically, offering "struggles" that are actually humble brags. (Everyone does this. It's still lonely.) You compare yourself to peers constantly. You resist asking for help because asking means admitting you need it.  
Somewhere along the way, you realize: nobody actually knows you anymore.  
This might be the strangest part of success. You're surrounded by people. You've never felt more alone.  
The founders who navigate this death find spaces where the performance can stop. Usually it's just one relationship. One person who isn't evaluating, investing, or angling for something. One place to say the unsayable.  
It sounds simple. It's surprisingly hard to let yourself have.  
The Death of Self  
This is the one that arrives without announcement.  
You started the company to solve a problem you cared about. Now you spend your days in board prep, HR escalations, and spreadsheets. You were the person who saw what others couldn't. Now you arbitrate between functions and manage expectations.  
Each small surrender made sense at the time.  
"I'll do less product work this quarter because we need to nail the fundraise."  
"I'll skip the morning run because there's a fire."  
"I'll cancel the trip because the team needs me."  
Reasonable choices.   
Except they compound.  
One day you look up and realize you've become very good at performing a role while the person underneath has gone faint. You've optimized yourself out of your own life.  
This is what that founder was describing. He built what he set out to build. And he disappeared in the building.  
I've felt this one myself. The slow drift. The growing distance from whatever it was that used to feel like me. Your body knows before your mind does: sleep fractures, tension accumulates in places you stop noticing, you become a floating head staring at screens.  
The founders who navigate this death protect something. A practice, a relationship, a commitment to themselves that isn't negotiable. They learn (usually the hard way) that you can't pour from a cup you've slowly crushed.  
The Spiral  
Here's what makes this hard: the three deaths feed each other.  
Professional fear drives harder performance. Constant performance accelerates the drift from yourself. Drifting from yourself makes you less effective, which increases professional fear.  
The spiral tightens.  
What I Keep Coming Back To  
The founders I most admire aren't the ones who built the biggest things.  
They're the ones who built something real and stayed whole.  
They took their own development seriously. They found at least one space where they could be honest. They protected their connection to themselves, even when the demands felt infinite.  
They understood something I wish I'd learned earlier: you can do hard things in a human way. Not despite your humanity. Through it.  
The three deaths are real. They're waiting.  
But they're not inevitable.  
You just have to see them coming.

## DOCUMENT 48: THE ART OF PLAYING TO WIN: WHY AN UNEXAMINED ORGANIZATION ISN'T WORTH MANAGING

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Art of Playing to Win: Why an Unexamined Organization Isn't Worth Managing  
Socrates famously stated, "An unexamined life is not worth living." 

This profound insight extends powerfully into leadership: 

"An unexamined organization is not worth managing."  
Many inexperienced CEOs fall into a dangerous trap. 

They chase grand visions, sprawling strategies, and ambitious goals, yet they neglect the fundamental questions that underpin organizational clarity. 

Without knowing their true North Star—the very essence of what their organization excels at—these leaders scatter their focus, dilute their impact, and drift towards mediocrity. Their businesses become reactive, responding to external pressures rather than proactively shaping their future.  
This lack of introspection is costly. When a company doesn't understand its core identity and strengths, it disperses energy across countless pursuits. 

It plays not to lose rather than playing boldly to win. This leads to diluted effectiveness, mediocre performance, and eventual organizational burnout.  
The solution?  
A Mindful CEO avoids this pitfall by embracing rigorous self-examination. Genuine strategic excellence requires courageously confronting difficult questions: "Who are we?" and "What do we truly excel at?" 

It involves discovering and fiercely protecting your organization's unique strengths—your "special sauce."  
Here's how mindful leaders achieve clarity:  
Playing to Win vs. Playing Not to Lose: 

When a mindful CEO chooses to play to win, they strategically invest energy into their organization’s Zone of Genius—the unique intersection where passion and proficiency collide. They delegate tasks that fall outside their zone, refuse to dilute their focus, and boldly lead their organization toward clearly defined victory.  
Playing not to lose:  
Leads to risk-averse behavior, scattering efforts broadly.  
Often creates cultures of mediocrity and incrementalism.  
Playing to win:  
Fosters boldness, courage, and strategic commitment.  
Channels energy toward focused excellence, leveraging organizational strengths.  
Ultimately, great leaders recognize that self-knowledge isn't philosophical masturbation—it's the core of strategic power. 

Through disciplined self-examination and clarity, Mindful CEOs create resilient, high-impact organizations with a compelling identity. They don't shy away from discomfort; they embrace it, knowing it's a catalyst for true greatness.  
Commit to Relentless Clarity  
A Mindful CEO understands that clarity isn’t a one-time event but a continuous journey. They frequently assess organizational identity, asking:  
“Who are we at our best?”  
“What are our unique strengths?”  
“What do we gladly leave to others?”  
Such introspection uncovers the essence of what makes the organization remarkable—its irreplaceable DNA.  
In summary:  
Remember, in a world obsessed with avoiding loss, the courageous and wise CEO chooses deliberately, passionately, and strategically—to play to win on their terms. They know and act in line with their organization’s DNA.   
Yours, 

Nikolas

## DOCUMENT 49: HOW TO NOT USE STRATEGY:  DON'T HIDE BEHIND THE 3 STRATEGY MASKS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to Not Use Strategy:   
Don't Hide Behind The 3 Strategy Masks  
No word is used as often to hide incompetence like strategy.   
In my work, i often revisit an organization’s strategy with a founder or CEO only to see that some basics are not covered.   
Worse even, I usually see the word is misused.   
Strategy is too often used to mask procrastination, politics and not-understanding.   
I call these the “3 strategy masks”.  
You need to spot these because if not 3 things happen:   
Ownership suffers  
talented folks that like to build leave   
collective intelligence suffers.   
Here are the 3 strategy fillers and how to spot them:   
A. Procrastination  
Hiding behind strategy often masks procrastination. Call it “Paralysis by analysis”. Strategy can be the word you use to hide your not-doing.   
\-\> Are you using the word strategy to mask inaction?  
B. Politics  
Strategy is often used to establish an unnecessary hierarchy of power. The narrative is this: The founder/CEO is the only one “capable” of doing the strategy. As a result, “the strategy owner” is the only one capable of taking decisions.  
\-\> Are you in charge of strategy because it gives you power over others?  
C. Not-understanding  
Most strategies I see read like someone is throwing “spaghetti on a wall” to see what sticks. That is plainly trying it all because you have no idea what it is that makes your sauce special.   
\-\> Is strategy your go-to word for “let’s try it all simultaneously”?   
Are you using “strategy” as a filler?   
If yes, please share your learnings with me.   
Next week we will explore the 6 strategy traps most CEOs fall for, and how to get out of the trouble.

## DOCUMENT 50: PETER DRUCKER’S “FIVE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS” FRAMEWORK

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Peter Drucker’s “Five Most Important Questions” framework  
The 5 most important questions every CEO needs to be able to answer:  
Most CEOs I know struggle to have essential answers about the nature of their organisation.  
Not because they are stupid.  
But, because they are too close to be able to see the essence.  
In my work with executives, the most significant added value I can provide is clarity. Because being in an organisation makes it impossible to see it clearly.  
This is why it is so important to have someone from the outside helping you see clearly:  
One of my favorite reflection tools for finding clarity in your organization comes from the grandfather of organizational development, Peter Drucker.  
Drucker says, and i agree wholeheartedly, that you have to know the answer to 5 questions about your organization by heart.  
I use Peter Drucker’s “Five Most Important Questions” framework as a strategic reflection tool to gain clarity, focus, and alignment quickly.  
And I hope that they help you get the essentials of your organisation right.  
Here are Drucker’s five essential questions you need to know to run your organisation:  
What is our mission?  
This question drives organizations to define their fundamental purpose. A clear mission acts as a guiding light, shaping every decision and ensuring that everyone understands why the organization exists.  
Who is our customer?  
Drucker emphasized knowing exactly who the organization serves. This question encourages leaders to be precise about who their target customer is, distinguishing primary and secondary customers.  
What does the customer value?  
Here, Drucker pushes organizations to step into their customers’ shoes and understand what truly matters to them. Knowing what customers value—not just what the company thinks they value—ensures that the organization delivers genuine value and relevance.  
What are our results?  
This question focuses on measuring the impact of the organization’s efforts. Drucker believed it was crucial to define what success looks like and regularly evaluate whether the organization’s actions are achieving the desired outcomes.  
What is our plan?  
This question helps translate insights and intentions into action. It encourages organizations to lay out a clear, actionable strategy for moving forward, including setting objectives, defining resources, and establishing timelines.  
These questions serve as a strategic self-assessment. Use them to stay mission-focused and stay on course.  
And never forget, the classics of org dev, like this tool have passed the test of time. They are beyond trends and will serve you well.  
Wish you a great day,  
Nikolas  
10 Ideas from Peter Drucker I don't want to forget:   
Peter Drucker, is often called the “father of modern management."  
No other management thinker was as productive and profound as Peter F. Drucker.   
He asked, ‘What is the best way to lead a company?’ And his timeless answers still hold true.   
Here are the 10 ideas I always return to:   
1\. The Purpose of a Business is to Create a Customer  
“There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer… It is the customer who determines what a business is, what it produces, and whether it will prosper.”  
2\. Management by Objectives (MBO)  
“Management by objectives works if you first think through your objectives. Ninety percent of the time you haven’t.”  
3\. Effectiveness Over Efficiency  
“Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.”  
4\. The Need for Continuous Learning and Adaptation  
“Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and increased constantly, or it vanishes.”  
5\. Decentralization and Empowerment  
“Decentralization is based on the belief that one does not make people ‘do’ what we want them to do; instead, we need to trust them to do what we hope they will do.”  
6\. The Importance of Innovation  
“Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship… the act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth.”  
7\. Focus on Strengths, Not Weaknesses  
“The task of leadership is to create an alignment of strengths, making our weaknesses irrelevant.”  
8\. Know Your Mission  
“The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said.”   
9\. The Concept of “Abandonment”  
“If you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.”  
10\. The Importance of Asking the Right Questions  
“The important thing is not to stop questioning.”  
Drucker’s insights continue to resonate because they focus on fundamental structures of purpose, strategy, and leadership, emphasizing alignment between actions and values. He reminds leaders that the true focus of leadership must remain on what truly matters.

## DOCUMENT 52: THE MINDSET CULTURE TEST

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Mindset Culture Test: Driving Organizational ExcellenceHow to Cultivate a High-Performing Mindset Culture  
Every organization operates within a unique Mindset Culture, which fundamentally shapes how success is defined, pursued, and achieved. These deeply ingrained beliefs and behaviors influence employee thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and overall performance.-----Growth Culture vs. Star Culture: Key Differences  
Organizational mindsets can be broadly categorized into two types: the Culture of Growth (or Growth Mindset) and the Culture of Genius (also referred to as Star or Fixed Mindset).  
Culture of Genius (Star/Fixed)  
Culture of Growth  
Focus: Offers highest performance opportunities.  
Focus: Offers highest growth opportunities.  
Emphasis: Employees’ talents and innate successes.  
Emphasis: Employees’ motivation, effort, and hard work.  
Priority: Focuses strictly on results.  
Priority: Focuses on both results and the learning process.  
Atmosphere: An environment of "bests"—best instincts, best ideas, best people.  
Atmosphere: Fosters a love for continuous learning, passion, creativity, and resourcefulness.  
\-----Conducting the Cues Audit  
To better understand your organization's mindset culture, conduct a Cues Audit, a framework developed by Stanford Professor Mary Murphy. This audit helps you identify whether your environment leans more toward a Growth Culture or a Star Culture.  
Reflect on the following cues and determine which statements align more closely with your organization's current practices and environment:  
Dimension  
Growth Culture (Focus on Learning and Collaboration)  
Star Culture (Focus on Proving and Individual Achievement)  
1\. Collaboration vs. Competition  
People are rewarded for working together and mutual support.  
People are rewarded when they outperform others.  
2\. Team vs. Individual Focus  
Everyone is focused on building a strong, cohesive team.  
Everyone is focused on being the top individual performer.  
3\. Learning vs. Proving  
The most important thing is demonstrating learning, growth, and development.  
The most important thing is proving you are smarter than others.  
4\. Risk-Taking  
Risk-taking is supported when it generates learning, even if it results in failure.  
Risk-taking is supported only when it leads to success.  
5\. Mistakes & Feedback  
Mistakes are viewed as opportunities to learn, with an emphasis on understanding and improving.  
Mistakes lead to finger-pointing and identifying who lacks skill or smarts.  
6\. Innovation & Experimentation  
Success is associated with trying new ideas, even at the risk of failure.  
Success is associated with avoiding mistakes at all costs and sticking to the known.  
7\. Creativity vs. Proven Methods  
Innovation and new ideas are encouraged and welcomed.  
There is a focus on replicating past successes and prioritizing proven methods.  
8\. Adaptability  
The group is flexible and easily adapts to change and new circumstances.  
The group resists change and prefers stability and the status quo.  
9\. Failure Response  
Failures are occasions for reflection and understanding.  
Failures lead to ridicule or punishment.  
10\. Ethical Behavior  
Operating ethically and transparently is of utmost importance.  
There is a tolerance for cheating, information hoarding, and cutting corners if it leads to success.  
11\. Responsibility  
Individuals take full responsibility for their mistakes and learn from them.  
Mistakes are hidden or blamed on others.  
12\. Ethical Discipline  
Unethical behavior is strictly penalized.  
Unethical behavior may be overlooked or even rewarded if it leads to success.  
13\. Inclusivity  
All backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are valued and appreciated.  
Certain backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are favored over others.  
14\. Idea Elevation  
Good ideas are elevated from everyone and benefit the entire group.  
Only the ideas of a select few “stars” are valued and elevated.  
15\. Diversity  
The group seeks diverse backgrounds, cultures, views, and identities for collective benefit.  
The group aims to replicate the backgrounds and identities of its top performers.  
\-----Why Culture Matters  
Growth Cultures foster environments where learning, collaboration, and ethical behavior are prioritized, leading to sustainable success and adaptability.  
Star Cultures, on the other hand, often focus narrowly on individual achievements, which can foster unhealthy competition, short-term thinking, and organizational fragility.  
Identifying your current culture and intentionally shifting towards a Growth Culture can unlock your organization’s full potential, encouraging continuous improvement, innovation, and a more inclusive and resilient environment.-----Next Steps for Culture Transformation  
Conduct the Audit: Have your team or organization honestly assess which of the cues resonate most with their daily experiences.  
Reflect on Results: Identify specific areas where your culture needs to shift to be more growth-oriented.  
Implement Changes: Develop and deploy strategies to encourage a Growth Culture, focusing on collaboration, learning, and inclusivity in policies and daily interactions.  
Monitor Progress: Regularly revisit the cues to ensure your organization is consistently moving toward a growth-oriented mindset and sustaining the positive changes.  
By understanding and evolving your organization’s mindset culture, you can better align your team’s behaviors and beliefs with your growth objectives, leading to sustained success and innovation.

## DOCUMENT 53: HOW TO SPOT INCOMPETENCE:  3 STEPS TO AVOID THE PETER PRINCIPLE TRAP

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to spot incompetence:  
3 steps to avoid the Peter Principle Leadership Trap:  
The Peter Principle, a concept in management theory, suggests that...  
"in a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence."  
The journey feels natural:  
1\. You start your business, and things are going great.  
2\. You're in your element, leading a tight-knit team of people you know and trust.  
3\. Your startup begins to scale, and suddenly...  
\- You're hiring more people.  
\- Your team is growing, and not everyone is an old pal.  
\- You're stepping into uncharted territory as a leader.  
But then...  
You hit the ceiling. Things aren't running as smoothly.  
Why?  
You rose to your "level of incompetence."  
You're great at running a small team...  
....but leading a rapidly scaling startup?  
→ You rose to the level of your incompetence.  
Here is how to get out:  
1\. Awareness of what you don't know:  
  \- Realize that what got you here won't get you there. New phase, new skills needed.  
"Hey, I'm great at this small team stuff, but scaling? I need to up my game."  
2\. Skill Up or Team Up:  
  \- Either learn the new skills needed for scaling or bring in someone who has them.  
"I need to learn about organizational development, get a coach, and maybe hire a COO."  
3\. Drive Change  
  \- Accept that change is part of growth. Embrace it rather than resist it.  
"This scaling phase is tough but also an exciting challenge."  
I know these thoughts hurt:  
"How do I develop these new skills?"  
"Am I the right person to lead at this stage?"  
Here's the thing:  
You don't have to become a different person.  
→ But you do need to evolve. Or find someone who has done it.   
Your organization's success depends on it.

The same counts for the people you lead. Use this model to see to find the right fit for your team.   
Don't fall for the Peter Principle trap. Spot and address your incompetence.

## DOCUMENT 54: FOUNDERS LONELINESS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to overcome the loneliness of being a founder:  
Being a founder is a solitary game.  
All founders I know share a similar experience:  
"The more my company grows, the lonelier I feel."  
Why are you feeling increasingly alone?  
a) UNIQUE CHALLENGES:   
Your issues are specific and complex, making it hard for others to relate.  
b) HIGH EXPECTATIONS:  
Carrying the weight of your team and investors' expectations is isolating.  
c) LIMITED SHARING:  
Sensitive information can rarely be discussed openly, narrowing your circle of confidantes.  
Loneliness is a symptom of stepping into responsibility.  
Your job is to absorb all problems and solve them.  
But where do you go with your problems?  
Here is how you can reduce loneliness heads-on:  
1\. Find a Good Coach  
→ Find an executive coach to navigate the challenges you are facing. Share the burden of your sensitive challenges. Together, you can brainstorm solutions for organizational and personal growth.  
2\. Engage in Peer Networks:  
→ Engage with fellow founders or business leaders. Organizations like Entrepreneurs Organization or YPO are great for companionship. Connect with fellow founders on your journey.  
3\. Focus on your Self-care  
→ Prioritize time for personal life and hobbies. Schedule what nourishes you in your calendar ahead of everything else. Remember you want to run the marathon and enjoy the race.  
4\. Role model for a High Trust Company Culture  
→ Share more than you are comfortable with. Most founders keep too many challenges from their colleagues. Be more vulnerable. Ask questions instead of giving answers. Don't try to be the smartest guy in the room.  
Remember: Feeling lonely with increasing growth is more common than not.  
How to overcome the loneliness of being a founder:  
1\. Find a Good Coach  
2\. Engage in Peer Networks  
3\. Focus on your Self-care  
4\. Role model for a High Trust Company Culture  
Reflect: What has helped you to deal with your loneliness as a leader?

## DOCUMENT 55: THE THREE TRANSITIONS OF GROWING ORGANIZATIONS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to scale successfully:  
The Three Transitions of Growing Organizations.  
As a founder coach for scale-ups, I have repeatedly seen these three growing pains.  
I call them "The Three Transitions":  
Why?  
Because all growing organizations face these three transitions in their leadership as they scale.  
If you are a Founders and CEOs of a scale-up organizations, you must get these three transitions right to succeed.  
The 3 Transitions:  
1\. Moving from Founder-led to Leadership Team-led  
→ Collective Intelligence beats individual leadership: As you grow, you want to get the best people in the room. With a growing leadership team, you are moving to becoming a conductor of intelligence.  
Your Task: Learn to Coach and set your leadership team up for success.  
2\. Moving from Expert CEO to Generalist CEO  
→ You want your employees to know more than you. With increasing experts in your organization, you are doing something wrong if you are still the most intelligent guy in the room. Don't beat yourself up if your CTO knows more than you.  
Your Task: Hire Experts and learn to become savvy in understanding all parts of the organization.  
3\. Moving from working on the Product to working on the Organization  
→ The transition from captain to shipbuilder. With a leadership team and experts in place, you are now primarily focused on creating a high-performance/high-trust organization.  
Your Task: Learn the best of organizational design & design your organization for success.  
Founders and CEOs of scale-up organizations have to get these 3 transitions right if they want to be successful:  
1\. Moving from Founder-led to Leadership Team-led  
2\. Moving from Expert CEO to Generalist CEO  
3\. Moving from working on the Product to working on the organization  
Reflect: How did you manage those transitions? Where are you stuck?

## DOCUMENT 56: THE FOUR QUADRANTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP: HOW WISE CEOS SCALE COMPANIES BY SOLVING THE RIGHT PROBLEM

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Mindful CEOs Guide to Organizational Leadership: The Four Quadrants of Organizational Leadership

Most inexperienced CEOs solve the wrong Problems.

As a result they are making things worse rather than better.  
A common mistake I often see in my coaching work:  
A growing company CEO notices a decline in employee performance.

“They are not pushing enough”, she says sighing.   
Her intuitive response is to introduce stricter KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and tighter performance metrics.   
While well-intended, this typically aggravates rather than resolves the issue.   
Why?   
Because the root cause often lies not at the process level but deeper within mindset, culture, or leadership.  
For instance, perhaps employees aren't underperforming because they lack clear KPIs.   
Instead, they may lack intrinsic motivation, feel disconnected from the company's values, or the hiring processes haven't prioritized essential traits like agency or alignment with the organizational culture.  
When CEOs misdiagnose the issue, it can trigger costly workshops, long ass change processes, employee frustration, and ultimately minimal lasting improvement.  
Mindful CEOs approach this differently.   
They understand that accurately diagnosing the root cause of a challenge—whether it stems from Mindset, Leadership, Culture, or Processes—is vital.  
To help CEOs develop this critical skill, I introduce them to the Four Quadrants of Organizational Leadership.  
Inspired by Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory, this model divides organizational leadership into four distinct but interconnected quadrants:  
Mindset (Individual, Inner)  
Thinking, feeling, beliefs  
If the core issue is mindset, no amount of KPIs will improve performance. Leaders must foster a growth mindset, encouraging employees to embrace challenges and adapt positively to change.

Leadership (Individual, Outer)  
Knowledge, capabilities, behavior  
Challenges here suggest a need for improved leadership skills. Perhaps leaders need better coaching or clearer role models who exemplify desired behaviors.

Culture (Collective, Inner)  
Values, relationships, codes  
A misaligned or weak culture can lead to disengagement. Wise CEOs reinforce clear values, strengthen internal relationships, and ensure the organization’s culture aligns authentically with its mission.

Processes (Collective, Outer)  
Organizational models, resources, products  
Only once you've determined that the issue truly lies here should you implement rigorous processes or performance measures like KPIs. Effective processes support the overall organizational structure without creating unnecessary constraints.  
Mindful CEOs don't jump immediately to process solutions.   
Instead, they first identify the correct quadrant in which the true issue lies.   
By thoughtfully assessing each quadrant—Mindset, Leadership, Culture, and Processes—they ensure targeted and genuinely effective solutions.  
When a CEO correctly diagnoses where the real problem originates, they scale not only sustainably but meaningfully, fostering a healthy, resilient organization poised for long-term success.  
Are you solving your organization's challenges at the right level?

## DOCUMENT 57: MASTERING LEADERSHIP WITH THE ROLE RADAR: A CEO’S GUIDE TO AUTHENTIC AND EFFECTIVE ROLE MANAGEMENT

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Mastering Leadership with the Role Radar: A CEO’s Guide to Authentic and Effective Role Management  
CEOs face increasing demands that blur lines between their professional, organizational, and personal worlds.   
The “Role radar”model by my mentors Bernd and Bertine Kessel, rooted in resource-oriented transactional analysis, offers executives a sophisticated yet practical framework for navigating these complexities effectively.  
1\. Contextualizing Your Roles  
Begin by clearly identifying your roles across three critical domains:  
Professional World: The domain of expertise and strategic insight.  
Organizational World: The operational sphere driven by structures, processes, and collective goals.  
Private World: Your personal and familial sphere, defined by individual values and relationships.  
Ask yourself:  
"What roles do I hold in each domain?"  
"What expectations do I and others have regarding these roles?"  
2\. Sensing Role Clarity and Conflict  
Two key pitfalls can complicate role clarity:   
1\. "Role Blur," where boundaries between roles become indistinct  
Ex. An inexperienced CEO wants to be nice instead of prioritizing the organisation (no self-prioritisation of role)  
"Role Fixation," when outdated role strategies are mistakenly applied to new contexts.  
Ex. A CEO Co-founder with tech knowledge focuses on “clean code” instead of focusing on the survival of the organisation (fixation on expert role)  
Reflect on these questions:  
"Am I clear about when to separate professional and personal strategies?"  
"Do I unwittingly prioritize 'favorite roles' at the expense of other important responsibilities?"  
"Am I adequately equipped to handle my role transitions, especially during pivotal changes like promotions or personal milestones?"  
3\. Assessing Role Competence  
Each role demands unique skills and competencies. Identifying gaps early and proactively developing required competencies is essential.  
Explore:  
"Am I aware of others' expectations regarding my role-specific competencies?"  
"Am I actively and continuously investing in developing necessary leadership skills?"  
"How do I avoid misinterpretations and continuously calibrate my understanding of my roles?"  
4\. Managing Role Priorities and Competition  
Inevitably, CEOs encounter situations where roles from different domains compete, such as critical organizational demands clashing with significant personal commitments.  
Examine these tensions:  
"Which roles take precedence in specific situations, and why?"  
"Am I making deliberate choices rather than passively succumbing to pressures (shifting from 'I must' to 'I choose')?"  
"Where might I be neglecting a role, and how can I balance my commitments thoughtfully?"  
5\. Achieving Role Integration and Authenticity  
True leadership mastery emerges when CEOs achieve role integration—aligning their authentic self across professional, organizational, and private domains.  
Reflect deeply:  
"Am I in roles that authentically match my strengths and personal values?"  
"Do others perceive consistency and authenticity in my role execution, even under stress?"  
"Am I allowing myself the freedom to consider role adjustments or changes when experiencing persistent role dissonance?"  
Conclusion: Your Path to Resilient Leadership  
The Rolle radar is more than a strategic tool—it's a pathway to resilient, authentic leadership.   
By consciously navigating the interplay between your professional, organizational, and private worlds, you not only enhance your effectiveness as a CEO but also deepen your authenticity and satisfaction in every dimension of your life.  
How to create Role Clarity: Taking the 4 Steps to Role Responsiblity  
1\. Contextualizing  
Questions:  
Which roles do I assume in these three areas of life?  
What are my expectations of these roles?  
What expectations do others have regarding my roles?  
Role Ambiguity and Role Fixation   
"Role ambiguity" describes overlapping role logics, for instance, when individuals attempt to solve problems from one sphere of life using strategies from another, such as addressing organizational issues with private-life strategies ("We're a family, after all\!") or vice versa.  
Questions:  
Which stages and role allocations align authentically with me?  
Are there "favorite roles" that dominate other areas of life?  
Do I perceive priorities among my roles?  
Can I appropriately shift from one role logic to another based on the situation?  
Role Exclusion  
 Problems often arise within a life sphere when individuals habitually try to live new roles according to old role logics, such as when someone transitions from colleague to manager or couples become parents.  
Questions:  
Have I thoroughly understood the priorities of my role(s)?  
Can I distinguish between organizational and personal problems?  
Have I internally embraced my roles—with all their advantages and disadvantages?  
Is there an understanding of complementing other roles?  
Have I consciously let go of previous roles?  
2\. Exploring Relevant Role Logics  
Role Competence Each role requires specific competence, which may need to be acquired anew with a new role.  
Questions:  
Do I understand the expectations of others, the values, strategies, and methods associated with my role?  
Am I willing to engage in this reflective process and dedicate time to it?  
How do I ensure I avoid misinterpretations?  
How do I acquire necessary personal and professional competencies?  
Role Priority Often, we can meaningfully reduce the complexity of a situation by clearly identifying which sphere predominantly shapes it—private, professional, or organizational.  
Questions:  
What does my role landscape look like?  
Which sphere and role logic currently takes precedence?  
Which specific role within a sphere (among several) is currently dominant?  
How can I remain faithful to these roles? What does that mean in practice?  
Where might I be falling short? How can I balance this?  
Role Competition   
Situations sometimes involve an irreconcilable conflict between two spheres of life, such as an important professional appointment coinciding with a significant private event, like a child’s birthday.  
Questions:  
Are there competing role expectations? Which ones?  
How do I handle this ambivalence?  
How can I move from a passive stance ("I must...") to an active stance ("I choose to...")?  
Where do I feel I'm betraying a role or falling short? How can I create balance?  
3\. Integrating Relevant Role Logics  
Role Authenticity Problems in the professional domain may occur when someone occupies a role unsuited to their nature, like a leadership or project management role that doesn't align with their inherent strengths, despite their expertise.  
Questions:  
Do I internally permit myself to assume roles aligned with my strengths, irrespective of external evaluations (career clichés or family scripts)?  
Do I grant myself the internal freedom to shape roles authentically (within the framework of existing role sets)?  
Do I allow myself to consider a role change when experiencing significant inner dissonance?  
4.Role Integration   
Effectively navigating various roles across life’s three spheres also depends on how these worlds relate to each other. Successful role integration means a person's core essence remains consistent across all three worlds without fragmenting into different personas (e.g., "tough at work" versus "loving in the family").  
Questions:  
Can I comfortably transition from one role to another?  
Do others perceive consistency in my roles?  
Can I maintain role fidelity under stress?  
Does an ease develop in consciously managing "favorite roles" that continually try to take precedence?

Mastering Leadership with the Role Radar: A CEO’s Guide to Authentic and Effective Role Management  
In today's dynamic business landscape, CEOs face increasing demands that blur lines between their professional, organizational, and personal worlds.   
The “Role radar”model by my mentors Bernd and Bertine Kessel, rooted in resource-oriented transactional analysis, offers executives a sophisticated yet practical framework for navigating these complexities effectively.  
1\. Contextualizing Your Roles  
Begin by clearly identifying your roles across three critical domains:  
Professional World: The domain of expertise and strategic insight.  
Organizational World: The operational sphere driven by structures, processes, and collective goals.  
Private World: Your personal and familial sphere, defined by individual values and relationships.  
Ask yourself:  
"What roles do I hold in each domain?"  
"What expectations do I and others have regarding these roles?"  
2\. Sensing Role Clarity and Conflict  
Two key pitfalls can complicate role clarity:   
1\. "Role Blur," where boundaries between roles become indistinct  
Ex. An inexperienced CEO wants to be nice instead of prioritizing the organisation (no self-prioritisation of role)  
"Role Fixation," when outdated role strategies are mistakenly applied to new contexts.  
Ex. A CEO Co-founder with tech knowledge focuses on “clean code” instead of focusing on the survival of the organisation (fixation on expert role)  
Reflect on these questions:  
"Am I clear about when to separate professional and personal strategies?"  
"Do I unwittingly prioritize 'favorite roles' at the expense of other important responsibilities?"  
"Am I adequately equipped to handle my role transitions, especially during pivotal changes like promotions or personal milestones?"  
3\. Assessing Role Competence  
Each role demands unique skills and competencies. Identifying gaps early and proactively developing required competencies is essential.  
Explore:  
"Am I aware of others' expectations regarding my role-specific competencies?"  
"Am I actively and continuously investing in developing necessary leadership skills?"  
"How do I avoid misinterpretations and continuously calibrate my understanding of my roles?"  
4\. Managing Role Priorities and Competition  
Inevitably, CEOs encounter situations where roles from different domains compete, such as critical organizational demands clashing with significant personal commitments.  
Examine these tensions:  
"Which roles take precedence in specific situations, and why?"  
"Am I making deliberate choices rather than passively succumbing to pressures (shifting from 'I must' to 'I choose')?"  
"Where might I be neglecting a role, and how can I balance my commitments thoughtfully?"  
5\. Achieving Role Integration and Authenticity  
True leadership mastery emerges when CEOs achieve role integration—aligning their authentic self across professional, organizational, and private domains.  
Reflect deeply:  
"Am I in roles that authentically match my strengths and personal values?"  
"Do others perceive consistency and authenticity in my role execution, even under stress?"  
"Am I allowing myself the freedom to consider role adjustments or changes when experiencing persistent role dissonance?"  
Conclusion: Your Path to Resilient Leadership  
The Rolle radar is more than a strategic tool—it's a pathway to resilient, authentic leadership.   
By consciously navigating the interplay between your professional, organizational, and private worlds, you not only enhance your effectiveness as a CEO but also deepen your authenticity and satisfaction in every dimension of your life.  
How to create Role Clarity:The Role Radar  
1\. Contextualizing  
Questions:  
Which roles do I assume in these three areas of life?  
What are my expectations of these roles?  
What expectations do others have regarding my roles?  
Role Ambiguity and Role Fixation   
"Role ambiguity" describes overlapping role logics, for instance, when individuals attempt to solve problems from one sphere of life using strategies from another, such as addressing organizational issues with private-life strategies ("We're a family, after all\!") or vice versa.  
Questions:  
Which stages and role allocations align authentically with me?  
Are there "favorite roles" that dominate other areas of life?  
Do I perceive priorities among my roles?  
Can I appropriately shift from one role logic to another based on the situation?  
Role Exclusion  
 Problems often arise within a life sphere when individuals habitually try to live new roles according to old role logics, such as when someone transitions from colleague to manager or couples become parents.  
Questions:  
Have I thoroughly understood the priorities of my role(s)?  
Can I distinguish between organizational and personal problems?  
Have I internally embraced my roles—with all their advantages and disadvantages?  
Is there an understanding of complementing other roles?  
Have I consciously let go of previous roles?  
2\. Exploring Relevant Role Logics  
Role Competence Each role requires specific competence, which may need to be acquired anew with a new role.  
Questions:  
Do I understand the expectations of others, the values, strategies, and methods associated with my role?  
Am I willing to engage in this reflective process and dedicate time to it?  
How do I ensure I avoid misinterpretations?  
How do I acquire necessary personal and professional competencies?  
Role Priority Often, we can meaningfully reduce the complexity of a situation by clearly identifying which sphere predominantly shapes it—private, professional, or organizational.  
Questions:  
What does my role landscape look like?  
Which sphere and role logic currently takes precedence?  
Which specific role within a sphere (among several) is currently dominant?  
How can I remain faithful to these roles? What does that mean in practice?  
Where might I be falling short? How can I balance this?  
Role Competition   
Situations sometimes involve an irreconcilable conflict between two spheres of life, such as an important professional appointment coinciding with a significant private event, like a child’s birthday.  
Questions:  
Are there competing role expectations? Which ones?  
How do I handle this ambivalence?  
How can I move from a passive stance ("I must...") to an active stance ("I choose to...")?  
Where do I feel I'm betraying a role or falling short? How can I create balance?

Mastering Leadership with the Role Radar  
As CEOs, we constantly juggle competing demands across our professional expertise, organizational responsibilities, and personal lives. The lines blur, priorities clash, and authenticity suffers.  
The Role Radar model by Bernd and Bertine Kessel offers a clear framework to navigate this complexity.  
The Three Critical Domains:  
🎯 Professional \- Your expertise and strategic insight  
 🏢 Organizational \- Operations, processes, collective goals  
 🏠 Private \- Personal values and relationships  
Two Major Pitfalls:  
Role Blur: Boundaries become indistinct (being "too nice" instead of making tough decisions)  
Role Fixation: Applying outdated strategies (CEO-founder obsessing over code instead of company survival)  
The 4-Step Framework:  
1\. Contextualizing Identify your roles in each domain and understand expectations  
2\. Exploring Competencies Assess skills needed and invest in development  
3\. Managing Priorities Recognize competing roles and shift from "I must" to "I choose"  
4\. Achieving Integration Align roles with your authentic self while maintaining consistency  
The Bottom Line:  
True leadership mastery emerges when you seamlessly transition between roles while maintaining your authentic core. This isn't just about effectiveness—it's about finding satisfaction in every dimension of life.  
Question for fellow leaders: Which role currently demands the most attention, and how are you ensuring it doesn't overshadow other critical responsibilities?

## DOCUMENT 58: THE LEADER'S GUIDE TO STRATEGIC STRESS MANAGEMENT

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

From Stress Management to Stress Design: How I help leaders find the stress sweet spot:  
From Stress Management to Stress Design: How I help leaders find the stress sweet spot:  
Let's face it, we should know better.  
After 100+ years of research, we know stress follows the "Yerkes-Dodson curve"  
The curve is an inverted U where performance peaks at moderate arousal levels, then crashes under overload.  
But I still hear mostly moaning about "stress", or bragging about "pushing the limits".  
Seems like this field, like so many others, does not really enjoy nuance:  
You either hate stress, or you wear it like a badge of honor.  
Fortunately, you can be smarter.  
When I work with leaders, I throw those ideas into the trash.  
And we move to what really matters when you want to be a high performer:  
Designing stress to meet your needs.  
Lets start with how I do this:  
Step One : Unlearning  
get rid of the stress is either "good" or "bad" dichotomy.  
Its not about removing stress.  
Instead, it's about dialing in the right stress edge.  
The reality?  
You and your team's performance depends on finding their stress sweet spot.  
Step Two: Upskilling  
Study the 4 Stress Zones. Learn to locate yourself and how you feel:  
🥱 Under-Stimulation Zone: Endless meetings, quiet quitting, innovation drought  
⚡ Optimal Zone (Eustress): Flow states, rapid learning, healthy debate  
🔥 Overload Zone: Decision paralysis, team conflicts, 2 AM Slack messages  
💔 Burnout Zone: Cynicism, errors spike, LinkedIn profiles get updated  
Knowing those, you can make the Strategic Shift:  
Step Three: From Stress Management to Stress Design  
Now that you know the four levels of stress, you can move from reacting to stress. You can now intentionally calibrate it:  
Match challenge to skill level \- Stretch goals with adequate support  
Build in recovery rhythms \- Think sprints, not marathons  
Track leading indicators \- Heart rate variability, voluntary overtime, team sentiment  
Reframe stress as energy \- "This pressure means we're pushing boundaries"  
These three steps will help you sustain high performance without burning your wires.  
Start with yourself first. Leading yourself matters. Then apply those lessons to your organization.  
Organizations that master stress as a design variable will outperform those that treat it as an unfortunate side effect.  
Where do you currently sit on the performance curve?

## DOCUMENT 59: AMBIDEXTROUS ORG DESIGN: MASTERING THE ART OF INNOVATION AND EFFICIENCY

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Ambidextrous Org Design: Mastering the Art of Innovation and Efficiency  
How smart companies navigate the eternal tension between perfecting what works and discovering what's next  
In the corporate world, there's a fundamental tension that has plagued organizations since the dawn of business: Do you double down on what's working, or do you bet on what might work tomorrow? For decades, this felt like an either-or choice. Companies either became efficiency machines that gradually lost their innovative edge, or they became innovation labs that burned through cash without delivering consistent results.  
But what if this dichotomy is false? What if the most successful organizations are those that master both sides of this equation simultaneously?  
Enter the concept of organizational ambidexterity—the ability to excel at both exploitation (maximizing current capabilities) and exploration (discovering new opportunities) at the same time. Recent research reveals that companies practicing true ambidexterity see financial performance improvements of 27% on average, with those leveraging digital tools seeing gains of up to 40%.  
The Evolution of Thinking  
The journey to understanding organizational ambidexterity began over six decades ago. In 1961, researchers Burns and Stalker discovered that stable environments reward hierarchical, mechanistic structures, while turbulent environments favor organic, adaptive ones. This was the first hint that context matters more than universal best practices.  
The breakthrough came in 1991 when James March framed this as a learning problem. Organizations, he argued, face a fundamental trade-off between exploiting what they know and exploring what they don't. Exploitation involves refining existing competencies, improving efficiency, and executing known processes. Exploration involves experimenting with new possibilities, taking risks, and discovering new opportunities.  
By 1996, researchers Tushman and O'Reilly coined the term "ambidextrous organization," showing that successful companies could host two different operating logics under one roof. They studied companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard that maintained both highly efficient core businesses and separate units dedicated to breakthrough innovation.  
Today, the concept has evolved far beyond simple organizational charts. Modern ambidexterity encompasses structural, contextual, temporal, digital, and individual dimensions. The question is no longer whether to balance exploration and exploitation, but rather when, where, and who should tip the scales.  
What the Latest Research Reveals  
A comprehensive meta-analysis of over 1,200 research papers published in 2024 provides compelling evidence for ambidexterity's impact. The study found that organizations practicing ambidexterity show significant improvements in financial performance, with the effect amplified when digital tools facilitate knowledge flow between exploration and exploitation activities.  
Perhaps most intriguingly, recent research on temporal cycling suggests a third pathway beyond structural separation or contextual balance. Companies like Intel with their famous "tick-tock" strategy and Spotify with their beta releases deliberately alternate between exploit and explore phases, creating rhythm rather than balance.  
The emergence of AI has added another dimension. Forbes analysis suggests that large language models and machine learning can keep the "explore brain" always active without starving the "exploit body," by channeling weak signals directly into operational dashboards. This represents a fundamental shift from human-only to human-AI collaborative ambidexterity.  
A Stage-by-Stage Playbook  
The key insight from recent research is that ambidexterity isn't one-size-fits-all. Different organizational stages require different approaches:  
Discovery Stage (Under 50 people)  
At this stage, survival demands exploration-heavy learning loops, but cash flow discipline is non-negotiable. The solution is micro-ambidexterity: pair "competence cells" (people refining the core experiment) with "wildcards" (founder-led spikes into new technologies or markets). Weekly cadences keep both aligned without killing the startup's natural agility.  
The watch-out? Don't codify process religion too early—it kills option value when you most need it.  
Product-Market Fit (50-200 people)  
Now the organization needs reliability for customers and experiments for adjacent opportunities. This calls for contextual ambidexterity: build guard-railed autonomy through OKRs, radical transparency, and dedicated exploration time (like Google's famous 20% time). Layer on lightweight explore budgets, following Amazon's model of single-threaded teams.  
The challenge here is that founders often over-index on exploration while investors push toward exploitation. The solution is shared north-star metrics that balance both imperatives.  
Scaling Phase (200-1,000 people)  
Coordination costs explode and exploration drowns in process noise. This demands structural ambidexterity: spin out dedicated innovation labs with their own P\&L and talent rules. Hold monthly bridge councils to ensure knowledge crosses organizational boundaries.  
The risk is silos and envy. Prevent this by rotating high-potential employees between core operations and innovation labs every 18 months.  
Mature Enterprise (1,000+ people)  
The core business is efficient but potentially brittle. This calls for a dual operating system: maintain hierarchy for operations while running a volunteer, networked accelerator for frontier bets. Use temporal ambidexterity through quarterly innovation sprints where core teams temporarily down-tools to prototype new ideas.  
The enemy here is bureaucracy re-colonizing the innovation network. Combat this with sunset clauses on policies and teams.  
Renewal/Turnaround  
When performance is tanking and culture is brittle, deploy dynamic ambidexterity: rapid alternation of exploit and explore at the portfolio level. Kill underperforming products while acquiring or starting new ventures. Use AI to surface white-space opportunities and harvest cash from legacy lines.  
The key is sequencing quick exploitation wins before big-bang explorations to prevent change fatigue.  
Universal Design Principles  
Regardless of stage, certain design levers travel well across organizational contexts:  
Capital Allocation Dial: Boards should agree on an exploration cap (typically 10-15% of operating expenses) that flexes with runway and market turbulence. This removes the annual budget battle between exploration and exploitation advocates.  
Ambidexterity Dashboard: Track paired metrics like ROI on core business versus option value of the innovation pipeline. Leading indicators include idea-to-MVP cycle time and percentage of revenue from products less than three years old.  
Talent Circuits: Mandate that every manager spends time in both operations and innovation within a three-year period. This prevents the formation of hostile tribes and creates ambidextrous leadership.  
Culture Priming: Celebrate both predictability (in exploitation) and surprise (in exploration). Ritualize both through events like "Efficiency Oscars" and "Moonshot Show-and-Tells."  
Digital Backbone: Create a unified data layer that lets AI recommend whether new insights should flow to the exploration backlog or trigger exploitation optimizations.  
The Future of Ambidexterity  
Three emerging trends will reshape organizational ambidexterity in the coming years:  
AI copilots will weaponize individual ambidexterity, nudging engineers to pivot between refactoring and rethinking in real-time based on context and cognitive load.  
Predictive capital markets inside firms—with tokenized budgets auctioned weekly—promise an always-on exploit-explore equilibrium that responds to market signals faster than traditional planning cycles.  
Neuro-analytics may soon detect cognitive load and redirect people to their optimal zone, enabling algorithmic temporal ambidexterity at the individual level.  
The Bottom Line  
Organizational ambidexterity has evolved from a binary organizational chart hack into a sophisticated multi-layer capability. The art lies in matching the approach to the firm's stage and context. Get the cadence right, and you transform the old either-or dilemma into a permanent, compounding advantage.  
The companies that master this art won't just survive the tension between today and tomorrow—they'll thrive because of it. In an era of accelerating change, the ability to simultaneously perfect and pioneer isn't just an advantage—it's a necessity for long-term survival.  
The research is clear: ambidexterity isn't about finding perfect balance. It's about knowing when to tip the scales, and having the organizational muscle memory to tip them back when conditions change. The future belongs to organizations that can dance between exploitation and exploration with the grace of a practiced performer.

2020s  
Temporal & Digital Ambidexterity research  
Firms now alternate exploit/explore over time and embed ambidexterity in digital transformations.  
Green side’s “Fast-paced, idea-driven” items reflect the rise of data-fuelled experimentation. (journals.aom.org, researchgate.net)  
1\.  Roots: contingency theory meets innovation  
Burns & Stalker’s mechanistic/organic model was the first empirical shot at showing why rigid hierarchies thrive in stable markets but suffocate invention in volatile ones. Their language is old-school, yet the traits line up almost bullet-for-bullet with the Blue (orderly) and Green (adaptive) columns. (us.sagepub.com)  
2\.  The learning lens  
March reframed the debate as a learning calculus: exploitation pays the bills; exploration buys the lottery ticket. His inverted-U logic explains why Blue cultures value “efficiency” while Green cultures tolerate “risk.” (jstor.org)  
3\.  Ambidexterity takes centre stage  
By the mid-90s, Tushman & O’Reilly called for ambidextrous organisations—literally keeping two operating systems under one roof. Later, Gibson & Birkinshaw showed you can do this without splitting the org: foster a climate where people toggle modes. The dotted connector in your graphic visualises that switching cost. (journals.sagepub.com, sloanreview.mit.edu)  
4\.  Networks, not charts  
Kotter’s “dual operating system” pushed the idea into the boardroom: bolt a volunteer-driven strategy network (Green) onto the execution hierarchy (Blue) to keep pace with disruption. Agile, Lean-Startup and OKR movements quickly latched on. (hbr.org)  
5\.  Digital & temporal twists  
Recent scholarship tracks how data platforms let firms sense when to jump from exploit to explore and back—temporal ambidexterity. Studies in 2023 link digital-transformation success to the simultaneous use of AI for process efficiency (Blue) and for product experimentation (Green). (journals.aom.org, researchgate.net)  
Where the model is headed  
Personalised ambidexterity – Wearable analytics to spot individual “explore” vs “exploit” cognitive states.  
Platform governance – Cloud architectures that allocate resources dynamically between Blue and Green projects.  
Purpose as integrator – Shared mission narratives to prevent culture-split Balkanisation.  
TL;DR  
What looks like a simple Blue-vs-Green dichotomy is the visual child of six decades of research—from Burns & Stalker’s contingency roots, through March’s learning curve, to modern ambidextrous and digital-first theories. The infographic is a quick diagnostic; the real task for CEOs is to design the dial that moves teams along the continuum on demand.

## DOCUMENT 61: THE ONION THEORY OF RISK: WHAT EVERY FOUNDER NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT MONEY AND MILESTONES

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Onion Theory of Risk: What Every Founder Needs to Understand About Money and Milestones  
There's a framework that has stuck with me ever since I first encountered it. Marc Andreessen calls it the "Onion Theory of Risk," and he learned it from Andy Ratcliff years ago.  
It's deceptively simple. And like most deceptively simple ideas, it's profound.  
Here's the core insight: The single biggest thing entrepreneurs miss is the relationship between risk and cash.  
Not just raising cash. Spending it, too.  
The Onion at Day One  
Picture your startup on day one. It's not a company yet. It's a collection of risks stacked on top of each other.  
Founding team risk: Will the founders work well together? Are they the right people?  
Product risk: Can you actually build the thing?  
Technical risk: Maybe you need a machine learning breakthrough. Maybe you don't know if it's possible.  
Launch risk. Market acceptance risk. Revenue risk.  
If you're building a sales-driven business, there's cost-of-sale risk: Can you sell the product for more than it costs to sell it?  
If you're building a consumer product, there's viral growth risk: Will people share it?  
A startup at the beginning is just this long, honest list of uncertainties.  
Peeling the Layers  
Here's where the framework becomes useful.  
Running a startup (and raising money for one) is a process of peeling away these layers, one at a time.  
You raise seed money to peel away the first two or three risks. Founding team. Product. Maybe initial launch.  
You raise the A round to peel away the next layer. Perhaps you eliminate some recruiting risk by building out your engineering team. Perhaps you peel away customer risk by signing your first five beta customers.  
Each milestone achieved is a layer removed. Each layer removed is justification for raising more capital.  
The Pitch That Works  
When you walk into a meeting with investors for your Series B, the best version of that conversation sounds like this:  
"I raised a seed round. I achieved these milestones. I eliminated these risks.  
I raised the A round. I achieved these milestones. I eliminated these risks.  
Now I'm raising a B round. Here are my milestones, here are my risks. By the time I raise my C round, here's the state the company will be in."  
Then you calibrate the amount of money you raise (and spend) to the risks you're pulling out of the business.  
This sounds obvious. It is not how most founders operate.  
The Trap  
What happens instead, especially in frothy markets?  
Founders think: "Let me raise as much money as I can. Let me build the fancy offices. Let me hire as many people as possible. And hope for the best."  
Hope is not a strategy. It's a prayer dressed up in a pitch deck.  
More money does not equal less risk. In fact, the opposite is often true. More money can mask risks, delay reckoning, and create the illusion of progress where there is only activity.  
The Deeper Lesson  
What I love about this framework is that it's not just about fundraising. It's about clarity.  
It forces you to name your risks honestly. Not the risks you're comfortable discussing, but the ones that keep you awake at 2 a.m.  
It forces you to sequence. What must be true before the next thing can be true?  
And it forces you to calibrate. How much capital do you actually need to peel away the next layer? Not more. Not less.  
This is the opposite of the "growth at all costs" mentality. It's disciplined. It's intentional. It's sustainable.  
A Question for You  
If you were to write down every risk in your business today, layer by layer, what would be on that list?  
And which layer are you actively working to peel away right now?  
The founders who can answer this question clearly tend to raise better, spend smarter, and sleep easier.  
The onion doesn't lie. Neither should your roadmap.

## DOCUMENT 62: 5 ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How I design organizational models with leaders:  
Choosing your organizational model is one of the most important choices you need to get right as a leader.  
The best organizational structure  
→ empowers your people,  
→ aligns with your core values,  
→ enables you to achieve your strategic objectives.  
Unfortunately, there is no magic model that fits every organization.  
The fastest way to find your dream model:  
a) study top-of-class organizational models  
b) brainstorm with a coach and your leadership team  
c) iterate, listen, and learn  
To find a suitable model for an organization, I often begin with introducing the types of organizational models.  
Here are the five types of organization models (based on the groundbreaking book Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux):  
1\. POWER CENTRIC (red)  
→ Power-oriented, led by a strong leader.  
Suited For: Situations needing quick, decisive leadership, like startups in their early chaotic stage or small businesses in highly competitive environments.  
2\. HIERARCHY (amber)  
→ Highly structured and hierarchical, with clear roles and top-down leadership.  
Suited For: Traditional corporations, government agencies, or large institutions where consistency and stability are paramount.  
3\. MERITOCRACY (orange)  
→ Achievement-oriented, focusing on innovation and success.  
Suited For: Competitive businesses in markets that demand constant innovation and growth, such as tech companies or large-scale enterprises.  
4\. COLLABORATIVE (green)  
→ Values-driven, focusing on culture and empowerment.  
Suited For: Organizations prioritizing social responsibility, employee engagement, and community, like NGOs or socially-driven businesses.  
5\. EVOLUTIONARY (teal)  
→ Self-management, holistic approach, and evolutionary purpose.  
Suited For: Progressive companies that value adaptability, empowerment, and a holistic approach, suitable for industries like creative, tech, or start-ups aiming for high agility.  
In the quest for organizational excellence, one size does not fit all:  
You need to understand  
→ which style meets your DNA  
→ how much complexity everyone can handle  
→ how fast you need to adapt  
Finding a suitable organizational model is a journey of exploration, adaptation, and growth.  
In summary, to find the right fit for your organization you need to understand the 5 types of organizations:  
1\. POWER CENTRIC (red)  
→ Characteristics: Power-oriented, led by a strong leader.  
2\. HIERARCHY (amber)  
→ Highly structured and hierarchical, with clear roles and top-down leadership.  
3\. MERITOCRACY (orange)  
→ Achievement-oriented, focusing on innovation and success.  
4\. COLLABORATIVE (green)  
→ Values-driven, focusing on culture and empowerment.  
5\. EVOLUTIONARY (teal)  
→ Self-management, holistic approach, and evolutionary purpose.  
Reflect: What has helped you in finding the right organizational structure?

## DOCUMENT 63: HOW TO AVOID THE FIXED MINDSET FALLACY: 3 STEPS TO A GROWTH CULTURE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to avoid the Fixed mindset fallacy: 3 steps to a growth culture  
3 Non-negotiable strategies to cultivate a growth mindset in your organization:  
I meet many executives who think they are in a growth mindset, but their employees are in a "fixed mindset".  
They fall for the "fixed mindset" fallacy.  
They think others "intelligence is fixed" and therefore show a "fixed mindset" without realizing it.  
They are not alone.  
Most people get this wrong about the growth mindset.  
→ You are not stuck in a fixed mindset.  
In fact, you are constantly and gracefully shifting between growth and fixed mindsets.  
And the work culture you provide determines where people default to.  
I apply 3 tactics to help leaders to cultivate a growth mindset in your organization:  
1\. Reflect on your own mindset:  
Dedicate time to understand where you move to a fixed mindset and why  
2\. Value Effort Over Talent:  
Recognize and reward effort, even if the outcome isn’t perfect.  
3\. Review How your team got there:  
Dedicate time to work on the "how" and the results  
 I establish this very quickly with executives I work with, which always helps greatly.  
What helps you to create cultures where growth mindsets come more easily?

## DOCUMENT 64: 6 PILLARS OF INNOVATION

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to Stay Innovative: The 6 Pillars of Organizational Innovation.  
The hard truth:  
Organizations that "innovate" lead the way.  
Organizations that "fail at innovating" are left behind.  
Why?  
The level of innovation makes or breaks an organization.  
But many people get this wrong about innovation:  
Innovation  
\- is not a single thing  
\- needs to be implemented at many levels  
\- has to be designed at every touchpoint  
To excel, you will need to be innovative on many levels.  
But which?  
I assembled the "6 pillars of organizational innovation" as defined by the thought leader in their domain.  
I use this framework to help leadership teams reflect on where to fill gaps.  
Rate where your organization is on each of those 6 pillars:  
1\. Creative Innovation  
“Innovation is powered by a thorough understanding, through direct observation, of what people want and need in their lives and what they like or dislike about the way particular products are made, packaged, marketed, sold, and supported.”  
\- Tim Brown, CEO IDEO  
2\. Customer-Centric Innovation  
“Innovation is a new idea, which could be a product, a service, or a model that satisfies the needs of customers more effectively."  
\- Eric Ries, Inventor Lean Startup  
3\. Strategic Innovation  
“Innovation is a process by which a domain, a product, or a service is renewed and brought up to date by applying new processes, introducing new techniques, or establishing successful ideas to create new value."  
\- Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business School  
4\. Technological Innovation  
"Innovation includes both improvements in technology and better methods or ways of doing things. It can be manifested in product changes, process changes, new approaches to marketing, new forms of distribution, and new concepts of scope."  
\- Michael Porter, Harvard University  
5\. Market and Product Innovation  
“Innovation is the development of new values through solutions that meet new needs, inarticulate needs, or old customer and market needs in value-added ways."  
\- Philip Kotler, Kellogg School of Management  
6\. Innovation in Leadership and Management  
"Innovation is the process of creating something new that makes life better. Innovation is impossible without passion."  
\- Vijay Govindarajan, Harvard Business School.  
To excel, you will need to be innovative on many levels.  
To sum it all up, to stay innovative, you need to excel at these six pillars of organizational innovation:  
1\. Creative Innovation  
2\. Customer-Centric Innovation  
3\. Strategic Innovation  
4\. Technological Innovation  
5\. Market and Product Innovation  
6\. Innovation in Leadership and Management  
Where would you place your organization on each of the pillars of innovation?

## DOCUMENT 65: HOW TO FIND YOUR SPECIAL SAUCE: THE UNIQUE DNA OF TABASCO—AND WHY KNOWING YOURS MATTERS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to find your Special Sauce: The Unique DNA of Tabasco—and Why Knowing Yours Matters  
Here is how you can avoid diluting your brand’s DNA—and keep your “Special Sauce” intact.   
Most organizations eventually lose their original energy, drifting from the essence that once made them special.   
Yet, a few remarkable ones not only retain their core. But they even innovate by doubling down on their strengths. 

Studying them helps you to spot what makes your organization unique. 

Lets start with dissecting the special sauce of one of my favorite organisations: Tabasco.

Tabasco is one of these rare organizations.  
Tabasco isn't just a condiment; it’s a living legend.  
For more than 150 years, this fiery elixir from Avery Island, Louisiana, has seasoned meals around the globe, transcending mere brand recognition to become synonymous with its entire category. But how has Tabasco maintained its competitive edge amid changing tastes and fierce global competition?  
Let's uncover the strategic DNA behind Tabasco’s sustained success.  
In 1868, Edmund McIlhenny grew his first commercial pepper crop. By the following year, he shipped out 658 bottles of his fiery concoction, wholesale at a dollar apiece, primarily to grocers along the Gulf Coast, especially in New Orleans. He branded it “Tabasco,” derived from a Mexican Indian word believed to mean "place where the soil is humid."  
Today, more than 150 years later, TABASCO Sauce remains remarkably unchanged: the foundational recipe, the careful process, and the key ingredients persist.   
The main difference? Tabasco now ages its pepper mash even longer—up to three years in white oak barrels—and uses premium distilled vinegar.  
Rather than losing its core essence over time, Tabasco intentionally doubled down on it.   
Tabasco teaches us three timeless lessons:  
1\. Know Your DNA  
• They knew they were the original pepper sauce, so they stuck to peppers. If you’re known for something, make that the center of your universe. 

If you're renowned for pepper sauce, diversify within pepper sauces—but don't venture into ketchup. Stay true to what defines you.  
2\. Double Down on What Makes You Great  
• Tabasco’s secret? The barrel-aging process. They’ve never abandoned it; they made it even better by extending the aging time and using higher-quality vinegar.   
If long barrel aging sets you apart, don’t compromise or take shortcuts. Instead, extend and refine that unique attribute.   
3\. Play Where Only You Can Win  
• Tabasco realized nobody else had their peppers, their barrels, their tradition. They are the OG.   
When you have superior peppers and unmatched barrel-aging techniques, your competitors remain perpetual imitators. You own the original, authentic space.

Mindful CEO, know your special sauce: 

An inexperienced CEO tries to be “everything for everyone” and ends up being nothing special to anyone.   
A Mindful CEO identifies their distinctive strengths—then amplifies them.  
An inexperienced CEO might cut corners to boost margins.   
A Mindful CEO invests in deepening their strengths—even if that means aging your “mash” longer than everyone else.

Mindful CEO Spicy Take:   
• Define your “special sauce”—your organization’s DNA—and guard it with integrity.  
• Invest in the subtle improvements that keep your product (or service) unique.  
• Pursue strategic bets aligned with your core strengths; don’t get distracted by fads.  
When you stay laser-focused on what makes you distinctive, you don’t merely survive—you stand the test of time, just like Tabasco.   
And that is how you keep your organisations spark alive for generations to come.

## DOCUMENT 66: BOARD OF DIRECTORS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Why The Quality of Your Board of Directors Matters:  
A lousy board can destroy your company.  
A great board can make it fly.  
Let us unpack  
→what boards do  
→why they matter  
→and what are their disadvantages  
1/What is a Board of Directors?  
A Board of Directors is a group of individuals elected to represent the interests of shareholders or stakeholders.  
How?  
The board   
→ hires and evaluates the CEO   
→ oversees the activities of the company  
→ decides on high-level policy, strategy, and governance.  
2/ What do boards do?  
💡 Strategic Guidance  
Boards shape long-term strategy and ensure the company's actions align with its vision and goals.  
Famous Examples:  
😀 Apple's board made the strategic decision to bring back its co-founder, Steve Jobs. Apple would never be here without it.  
😰 Kodak's board failed to pivot towards digital photography despite inventing the first digital camera. Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012\.  
🛠️ Risk Management  
Boards identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them, protecting the company's interests.  
Famous Examples:  
😀 Toyota faced a recall due to safety issues in 2010\. Toyota's board launched an investigation and started reforms that led to revived trust.  
😰 Enron's board's lack of oversight over risks contributed to the largest bankruptcy filing of 2001\.  
 🔄 Corporate Governance  
Boards ensure transparency and fairness in the company's operations and decision-making processes.  
Famous examples:  
😀 Patagonia's board of directors has committed to environmental stewardship in its business model. Today, Patagonia is a role model for "sustainable-minded" organizations worldwide.  
😰 Theranos misleading claims: The lack of due diligence in verifying the CEO's claims of discovery  
3/ 🌟 Benefits of Having a Board  
• Diverse Perspectives:   
Boards improve strategic decision-making with knowledge from leading an organization or a specific understanding of the field.  
• Accountability:   
Boards ensure that the company adheres to legal standards and ethical practices.  
• Network & Resources:   
Board members often have extensive networks and resources, which can benefit the company's growth.  
4/ What many Boards get Wrong  
Great boards prioritize trust-building and radical honesty. Shitty boards play politics and withhold information.  
Here are my suggestions to board members for creating a high-trust/high-performance board atmosphere:  
→ Address the elephant in the room (with or without a coach): Dismantle "bombs" before they go off.  
→ Don't make demands of the CEO that are impossible to achieve and squeeze the soul out of a company.  
→ Role-model vulnerability and share what you don't know  
TL;DR:    
Good boards elevate a company. Shitty boards kill it:    
A good board will add   
\-\> Wide diverse perspectives  
\-\> Accountability    
\-\> Network and resources.  
A bad board can  
\-\> Slow down decision-making  
\-\> Fire great executives  
\-\> Be expensive to maintain.  
Reflect: What makes a good board?

## DOCUMENT 68: LEAVE WITH DECENCY

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to leave your company with decency  
You want to leave. You think it is time to depart.  
Avoid burning bridges. Don't overreact.  
Follow these steps and ensure that you will have an open door whenever it calls you back.  
1\. Understand what time here meant to you  
Before departing, feel into what binds you to the team and your mission. Ask yourself:  
∙What did you achieve here with your team?  
∙What were the challenges you never overcame?  
∙What emotions come up when you think of leaving?  
2\. Craft a compelling narrative of departure  
Not every reason or hardship needs to be known to everyone. Craft a narrative of departure that makes sense and helps all look good:  
∙Understand the needs of each party involved (investors, Leadership Team, Employees, Public).  
∙Map what concerns they might have after you leave.  
∙Draft a story that feels true to you and addresses key concerns.  
3\. Preserve your legacy  
You worked hard to shape this place. Put safeguards in place so that what matters to you stays.  
∙Reflect on your values and how they shaped the organization  
∙Map what you need to design to ensure that those values live on  
∙Investigate successful and unsuccessful CEO departures: What do you want to take over?  
4\. Make yourself replaceable  
In the best case, you leave the company in a better shape than with you. Putting your ego aside, map a future of how the company could thrive without you.  
∙Map critical positions that need to be filled to ensure success.  
∙Work with your leadership team to find a partner they want to work with.  
∙Ensure funding & role clarity to set them up for success; stay as long as they need to thrive.  
5\. Leave on a win-win  
Your share in the company should not be a liability for the team. Think of a win-win plan to ensure the company wins financially and legally.  
∙Create an overview of your and the company's legal and financial needs.  
∙Connect the dots: what offer could set you and the company up for success?  
∙Sit down with the key people and experts to brainstorm an exit that allows for the organization's success.  
In summary, how can you leave your company with decency  
1️⃣ Understand what time here meant to you  
2️⃣ Craft a compelling narrative of departure  
3️⃣ Preserve your legacy  
4️⃣ Make yourself replaceable  
 5️⃣ Leave on a win-win  
Reflect:   
What were organizational departures that inspired you? Why?

## DOCUMENT 69: HOW TO WORK ON THE RIGHT LEVEL: THE 3 LEVELS OF HIGH PERFORMING ORGANIZATIONS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How to work on the right level: the 3 levels of high performing organizations  
The biggest mistake successful founders make is continuing to measure their effectiveness based on their direct contributions to the company.   
This “in the company” approach, rather than “on the company,” limits growth potential.  
Why Working “On” the Organization Matters  
As a leader, only you can credibly work on the organization, rather than simply in it.  
	•	Experts: Work in their area of expertise.  
	•	Managers: Execute on projects.  
	•	Leaders: Guide the organization’s broader vision and direction.  
This concept was shared by my ForChiefs colleague, Frank Ardesch.  
Reasons Founders Shouldn’t Work “In” the Company  
	1\.	Lack of Time for Strategy and Vision:  
	•	The more successful the company becomes, the more clear leadership is required. Instead of staying “busy,” focus on the work only you can do.  
	2\.	Risk of Doing Unenjoyable Tasks:  
	•	You may find yourself working on tasks you don’t enjoy, often falling into the “zone of excellence”—work you’re good at but don’t love.  
	•	Tasks that drain your energy should be delegated to someone who enjoys them, allowing you to spend more time in your “zone of genius.”  
	3\.	Becoming a Bottleneck:  
	•	Rather than enabling growth, working in the company can make you the bottleneck.  
	•	Providing all the answers stifles ownership, innovation, and collective intelligence within the team. Instead, foster “collective intelligence” by acting as the shipbuilder who builds the team rather than captaining it.  
The Four Zones of Work (Source: Matt Morchary)  
	1\.	Zone of Incompetence: Tasks others could do better.  
	2\.	Zone of Competence: Tasks others can do just as well.  
	3\.	Zone of Excellence: Tasks you excel at but don’t necessarily enjoy.  
	4\.	Zone of Genius: Work you’re uniquely skilled at and love doing.  
Your goal should be to work primarily in your zone of genius.  
Reinventing Leadership for Growth  
As the company grows, each phase will require you to reinvent yourself. This shift from “in” to “on” the organization may feel counterintuitive but is essential for scaling.  
Key Actions for Working “On” the Organization  
	1\.	Identify the Direction: Determine where the organization should go.  
	2\.	Plan the Path: Outline what needs to be done to achieve that direction.  
	3\.	Align the Team: Inspire and communicate clearly to align everyone around the vision.  
Summary: Why You Should Work “On” Not “In” the Company  
	•	Focus on Strategy and Vision: Avoid tasks that drain your energy.  
	•	Enable, Don’t Control: Empower your team instead of becoming a bottleneck.  
Final Thought  
Founders should be working on and not in the organization.

This format highlights key points and emphasizes the strategic shift from operational tasks to leadership-focused actions. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to expand on or discuss further\!

## DOCUMENT 70: 4 REASONS TO HIRE A FACILITATOR

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The secret trick to productivity \- 4 reasons to hire a facilitator  
The best organizations in the world spend on world-class facilitators to lead through their most important meetings.  
Strategy Meetings: led by a facilitator  
Leadership Meetings: led by a faciltator  
Off-site: let by a facilitator  
What is a facilitator:  
A facilitator helps a group of people work together better by harvesting the collective intelligence to find common objectives and how to achieve them.  
4 reasons why the best organizations have facilitators for their off-sites:  
1\. Get more done in less time  
If you have a tight plan, you need someone that helps you to stay on course.  
Facilitators help you stay on topic, schedule, and hold your energy high.  
2\. Leaders can bring their full self  
If you are discussing strategy, you need your entire energy on the topic.  
Wise leaders delegate facilitation to participate with their full selves in essential discussions.  
3\. The collective intelligence gets a voice  
The introvert, the new leadership member, and the underrepresented have great ideas.  
Facilitators use methods that bring everyone to participate—the result: diverse opinions and better ideas.  
4\. Facilitators' productivity trickles into the company culture  
A leadership team quickly adopts the methods and pace of their facilitator & coach.  
Seeing a skilled facilitator in action inspires more great facilitation in-house.  
5 reasons why top organizations have external facilitators to lead their most important meetings:  
a. Get more done in less time  
b. Leaders can bring their full self  
c. The collective intelligence gets a voice  
d. Facilitators' productivity trickles into the company culture

## DOCUMENT 71: OFF-SITES

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

5 principles to make your Off-site a success:  
Off-sites are "Hackathons for Innovation."  
When designed and executed effectively, your off-site will help you ace what matters most:  
\- Getting your team to trust  
\- Aligning a killer strategy  
\- Tapping into the collective intelligence  
Off-sites are a game changer. But what separates an exceptional off-site from a mediocre one?  
Here are my learnings from facilitating 100+ leadership workshops and off-sites a year.  
5 Principles to make your off-site a success:  
1\. Aspirational places inspire aspirational thinking  
In the last year, I facilitated off-site in French 3-star restaurant vineyards \- the change in the team was immediate.  
→ Places inspire us. Ensure that the site inspires what you want to develop.  
2\. Great facilitation  
Nothing beats being in one place while being facilitated through deep processes.  
→  You want to be a participant and focus on getting things done. You can never get as much done alone as with a facilitator.  
3\. No phones  
Take breaks from focus. But don't indulge in distractions.  
→  Deep work needs space and attention.  
4\. Thinking fast and thinking slow  
Everyone is running \- but where are they running to?  
→  Transformation starts when you slow down to understand why you do things, readjust, and then pick up speed.  
5\. Set Clear Objectives and Goals  
What do you want to achieve?  
→  Define specific, measurable objectives for the off-site. Schedule follow-up meetings or check-ins to track progress and address any challenges post-offsite.  
These 5 principles will make your off-site successful  
1\. Choose an aspirational place  
2\. Invest in excellent facilitation  
3\. Remove distractions  
4\. Go slow to go fast  
5\. Set clear objectives and follow up  
What has helped you in making your off-sites successful?
