# What I Fixed - Aligned to Actual Product Strategy

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Issue:** I created copy based on copywriting framework but ignored your actual product strategy

---

## ❌ WHAT I GOT WRONG (V2)

### 1. Pricing - COMPLETELY WRONG
**I wrote:** $15/month + 7-day free trial
**Actually:** €100/month (premium positioning) + free initial assessment only

**Why this matters:**
- Your strategy explicitly says "NOT €15/month SaaS"
- Premium band (€80-100) reflects seriousness of work
- Cheap pricing undermines positioning

### 2. Free Trial - WRONG CONCEPT
**I wrote:** 7-day trial with access to everything
**Actually:** Free initial assessment only ("What's your #1 obstacle?")

**Why this matters:**
- Free assessment is the funnel, not a product trial
- You want to qualify people before they pay
- Different conversion psychology

### 3. Focus - INVERTED
**I emphasized:** Content library (50+ frameworks front and center)
**Should emphasize:** Weekly accountability check-ins (core value)

**Why this matters:**
- Product strategy says "accountability-first, not content library"
- Content is PRESCRIBED based on scores, not browsed
- Success metric is 80%+ weekly check-in completion, not downloads

### 4. Target Audience - TOO GENERIC
**I wrote:** "CEOs and founders" (generic)
**Should target:** Specific personas from strategy:
- First-time founders
- Technical leaders → now running teams
- High-paid specialists anxious about AI
- Solo entrepreneurs ($200k+)
- People who don't feel like "natural" CEOs

### 5. Messaging - ABSTRACTIONS
**I wrote:** "Consistent accountability, measurable growth" (abstract)
**Should write:** "Become more consistent and accountable" (direct to person)

**Why this matters:**
- Strategy explicitly says avoid abstractions
- Speak to the person, not list features

### 6. Unique Differentiator - MISSED
**I missed:** Hard measurement + spiritual depth combination
**Should emphasize:** NK unique mix:
- Masculine: structure, metrics, accountability
- Feminine: presence, inner work, stillness

## ✅ WHAT'S FIXED (V3 - Aligned)

### 1. Pricing Corrected
- **€100/month** (premium positioning)
- **Free assessment only** (not 7-day trial)
- Explanation of why €100 (serious work, premium brand)

### 2. Target Audience Specific
- Created "Is This You?" section with 6 personas
- Each card speaks to specific person from strategy:
  - "You Were the Technical Expert" → now leading
  - "AI Just Disrupted Your Edge" → anxious specialist
  - "You're a First-Time Founder" → no feedback
  - "You Make $200k+ Solo" → career as business
  - "Every New Tool Makes You Anxious" → measurement > tools
  - "You Don't Feel Like a 'Natural CEO'" → imposter syndrome

### 3. Accountability-First Positioning
- Hero emphasizes measurement and accountability
- Weekly check-ins are Step 2 in "How It Works"
- Content described as "prescribed, not browsed"
- Success framed as 80%+ weekly completion

### 4. NK Unique Mix Featured
- New section: "Hard Measurement + Deep Stillness"
- Two-column layout showing both sides:
  - Left: Objective business lens (structure, metrics, accountability)
  - Right: Nervous system depth (presence, inner work, stillness)
- Tagline: "This combination is rare. That's what makes CEO Lab different."

### 5. Messaging Direct to Person
- Changed "consistent accountability, measurable growth" (abstract)
- To: "Become more consistent and accountable" (direct)
- Speaks to individual transformation, not feature list

### 6. Insight Highlighted
- Full section on: "The Only Reliable Edge is Continuous Adaptation"
- Builds to: "But you can't adapt if you don't have measurement"
- Aligns with strategy positioning

### 7. Use Cases Added
- Performance reviews (track leadership over time)
- High-level roles (evidence for board seats, C-suite)
- Public accountability (shareable snapshots)
- "Spotify Wrapped" for leadership (annual review)

## 🚨 WHAT TO DELETE FROM V2

Delete these files (they're wrong):
- `index-v2.html` (wrong pricing, wrong positioning)
- `LANDING_PAGE_COPY_V2.md` (based on framework, not strategy)
- `FRAMEWORK_ANALYSIS.md` (compares to wrong baseline)

Keep these:
- `TESTIMONIALS.md` (testimonial collection strategy is still valid)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (tactics useful, just wrong product)
