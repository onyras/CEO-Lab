# CEO Lab Landing Page Workshop
## Complete Framework & Copywriting Guide

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive landing page strategy and copy for CEO Lab using the copywriting.io landing page framework.

**Instructions:** Work through each section systematically. Provide detailed answers, examples, and rationale. This will be used to build the actual landing page.

---

## Context: CEO Lab Product

**What it is:** CEO Lab is a premium accountability platform ($100/month) that helps founders and CEOs develop self-leadership through systematic measurement and tracking.

**Target audience:**
- First-time founders who don't feel like "natural" CEOs
- Technical specialists now leading teams/companies
- High-earning solo entrepreneurs ($200k+) treating their career as a business
- Series A/B CEOs anxious about AI disruption

**Core value proposition:**
- **Accountability-first, not content library**
- Monthly assessments measuring 18 leadership dimensions
- Weekly check-ins via WhatsApp
- Automated AI-generated reports showing growth patterns
- 50+ frameworks from the Konstantin Method prescribed based on gaps

**The core problem:** In times of extreme change, founders don't know if they're actually getting better as leaders. Without measurement, anxiety drives decisions instead of strategy.

---

## PART 1: FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### 1. About the Field

**Question:** What is the broader field/category that CEO Lab operates in? How do we frame this space for someone who's never heard of "leadership measurement" or "CEO accountability platforms"?

**Your task:**
- Describe the field in 2-3 sentences
- What analogies help explain it? (e.g., "Whoop but for leadership")
- What existing mental models can we borrow?
- Why does this field matter right now (2026)?

### 2. Relevance Section - User Research

**Question:** Why should our target CEO care about this right now? What makes this urgent?

**Your task:**

**2a. Current Pain Points**
List 5-7 specific pain points our target CEOs experience daily:
- What problems do they face?
- What keeps them up at night?
- What are they currently doing that isn't working?

**2b. The Core Emotion**
- What's the underlying emotion? (anxiety, fear, frustration, overwhelm?)
- How do they describe this feeling in their own words?

**2c. What They've Already Tried**
What solutions have they already attempted that failed?

- Frameworks?
- Why didn't these work?

3. Mechanism-focused version (how it works)

For each principle below, explain:
1. How it applies to CEO Lab
2. Specific copy or design element that leverages it
3. Example of how to implement it on the landing page

### 4. Labour Illusion
**Principle:** Showing the work/effort makes people value it more.

**Your task:** How can we show the "work" that goes into CEO Lab? (e.g., "100-question comprehensive assessment", "18 leadership dimensions measured")

---

### 5. Emotion (gain)
**Your task:** What positive emotions do CEOs experience after using CEO Lab? List 5 specific emotional gains.

### 7. Zero Risk Bias
**Principle:** People strongly prefer eliminating risk entirely.

**Your task:** What guarantees or risk-reducers can we offer? (free assessment, trial period, money-back guarantee?)

---

### 8. Reciprocity
**Principle:** Give value first, and people feel compelled to give back.

**Your task:** What free value can we give before asking for payment? (The 12-question hook assessment is one. What else?)

---

### 9. Beliefs
**Principle:** Tap into existing beliefs rather than trying to change them.

**Your task:** What do our target CEOs already believe about:
- Leadership development?

---

### 14. Arousal Theory of Motivation (Anxiety)
**Principle:** Optimal anxiety drives action. Too little = no urgency. Too much = paralysis.

- What's the "just right" anxiety message?
- How do we avoid creating too much fear?

---
